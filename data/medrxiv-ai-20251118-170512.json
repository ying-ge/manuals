    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects more than 250 million people. It is a heterogeneous disease with a variety of symptoms, severity, and underlying mechanisms. Long term remission has been achieved for small subgroups of people with asthma treated with targeted biologic therapy. Accurately defining asthma subgroups is therefore of upmost importance for further reducing the prevalence of asthma. The rapid rise in technologies that enable profiling of a spectrum of analytes provides the opportunity to accurately classify asthma subtypes and to elucidate the underlying causes of disease. Combining these technologies with artificial intelligence will enable more accurate disease prediction, precision diagnoses, and personalised treatments. A major challenge is the prioritisation and effective implementation of these technologies in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive imaging of skin diseases is highly valued in both dermatological research and practice. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is primarily applied to assess melanocytic lesions because of its high resolution, whereas optical coherence tomography (OCT) is particularly used for non-melanocytic skin tumors owing to its greater penetration depth. Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) combines the techniques of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), enabling visualization of the skin down to the superficial dermis while simultaneously providing cellular resolution. The visualization of the skin changes can be done horizontally, vertically, in 3D mode or as a video in real time. The evaluation of the measurement can be supported by artificial intelligence if required. The field of application of LC-OCT includes both melanocytic and non-melanocytic lesions. In addition, preliminary studies show great potential in the diagnosis and therapy control of inflammatory and infectious skin diseases. Nevertheless, RCM and OCT still have their place in special cases such as tumors requiring a particularly high resolution or penetration depth > 500 µm.",

This review synthesizes recent advancements across molecular pathogenesis, precision diagnostics, and therapeutic innovations. Key findings reveal that PDRA pathophysiology involves pregnancy-induced hormonal fluctuations, extracellular matrix remodeling, and mechanical overloading, necessitating individualized management. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced ultrasonography achieves superior diagnostic accuracy (Dice score: 85.93%, r = 0.944 vs. manual measurements) over traditional methods, while minimally invasive techniques including laparoscopic \"Slim-Mesh\" repair demonstrate reduced recurrence rates (< 10%) and enhanced recovery compared to open surgery. Biomaterial integration (such as synthetic and bioabsorbable meshes) promotes anatomical reconstruction. Intelligent rehabilitation systems combining surface electromyography and wearable sensors improve inter-rectus distance (IRD) reduction through real-time biomechanical feedback. Critical challenges persist regarding the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, long-term outcome validation of emerging technologies (> 5-year follow-up gaps), and optimization of AI-driven predictive models. We propose a potential precision medicine framework that integrates dynamic imaging, molecular profiling, and patient-specific interventions to optimize functional recovery and address heterogeneity in PDRA management.",

This review synthesizes the current workflow-from image acquisition and segmentation to feature extraction and modeling-and emphasizes clinical use cases: triage when tissue is limited, risk stratification, therapy selection (including immunotherapy), and longitudinal monitoring. Despite promising results, clinical translation is constrained by non-standardized imaging/feature pipelines, limited multi-center validation and calibration, vulnerability to data leakage, and challenges in interpretability, uncertainty handling, and software and model governance. We advocate treating genomic burden-tumor mutational burden (TMB), intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), and copy-number alterations (CNA)-as first-class endpoints and covariates, and outline a pattern-aware framework for EGFR T790M to inform surveillance and treatment sequencing. We also provide a practical reporting checklist and a pitfall-to-remedy table to support reproducible, multi-center studies and regulatory-grade documentation. Radiogenomics is best viewed as a complement to biopsy rather than a replacement. Real-world impact now depends on harmonized protocols, leakage-free external validation, explainable and uncertainty-aware models, and integration with multi-omics decision support to deliver reliable, patient-centered lung cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Clinical documentation burden remains a significant challenge in healthcare, particularly in primary care settings. Artificial intelligence (AI) scribes have emerged as potential solutions, but their effectiveness compared to human documentation lacks robust evidence, especially in community general practice environments. Documentation quality is compared between four commercial AI scribes and human-generated notes using four standardised clinical scenarios from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners examination repository in simulated general practice consultations. Three experienced general practitioners, blinded to the source, assessed quality using a modified Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI-9). AI-generated notes outperformed human documentation across multiple quality domains. Top AI scribes scored a mean of 44.08/50 (SD = 3.32) vs. 37.42 (SD = 9.78) for humans, excelling in thoroughness (M = 4.92), accuracy (M = 4.67), and freedom from bias (M = 4.92). Inter-rater reliability was high for thoroughness (ICC = 0.879) and accuracy (ICC = 0.745), but lower for subjective areas like synthesis (ICC = 0.082). This study shows that AI scribes can outperform traditional documentation in simulated general practice. Successful implementation, however, depends on workflow integration and customisation. Standardised evaluation and balancing consistency with clinical context are key. Future research should explore real-world use, focusing on customisation and workflow impact.",

    "abstract": "Prediabetes presents a critical window to prevent type 2 diabetes, a rising global health crisis, yet young adults often lack engaging preventive tools. This ongoing study aims to design and evaluate a web application to enhance health knowledge, engagement, and self-management for this at-risk group. This theoretical lens combines Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), the theory of Task-Technology Fit (TTF), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The proposed solution incorporates a unique combination of features learned through a previously conducted systematic literature review (SLR). Features include Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendations, educational modules, goal setting, gamification elements, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-incorporated chatbot. The proposed design to date is presented, in addition to the planned scenario-driven use cases to highlight the relevance of the proposed solution. A pilot study will assess usability, usefulness, satisfaction, and health knowledge via initial, midway, and final surveys mapped along with the design process. The data will be analysed via descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. This work-in-progress paper offers a streamlined, user-centred approach to designing and developing digital health interventions for prediabetes prevention while contributing insights for personalised digital health interventions.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the United States. Traditional management based on intermittent clinic visits and subjective symptom reporting often fails to detect early decompensation. Remote monitoring technologies-both invasive and noninvasive-are emerging as transformative tools for continuous, real-world surveillance of physiological parameters to guide heart failure management. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current and evolving landscape of remote hemodynamic monitoring, including left atrial, pulmonary artery, and inferior vena cava pressure sensors, as well as cardiovascular implantable electronic devices and wearable systems. Devices such as the CardioMEMS and Cordella have demonstrated decreases in heart failure hospitalizations and improvements in quality of life through hemodynamic-guided therapy. Noninvasive technologies, including patch-based sensors, wearable monitors, and artificial intelligence-driven voice analysis platforms, show promise for broader scalability. Despite demonstrated benefits, adoption remains limited owing to data integration challenges, reimbursement barriers, and a lack of standardized clinical workflows. To fully realize the potential of remote monitoring, strategies must focus on patient engagement, closed-loop feedback systems, integration with electronic health records, and personalized algorithms. A tiered approach that matches monitoring intensity to disease severity may optimize outcomes and transform heart failure care into a proactive, patient-centered model.",

    "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an autoimmune prompted skin disorder, whose hallmarks include the unpredictable onset of hives and itch. Symptom duration typically exceed 6 weeks, and flares can occur for up to 5 years or longer if untreated, impacting potentially any area of the body. The absence of obvious triggers and the variation in onset frequency often delays formal diagnosis which on average is approximately 2 years from first presentation. Initial standard of care is the use of low through to higher strength antihistamines in the first instance, with eventual escalation to prescription anti-inflammatory agents and potentially biologics once patients are under managed care. The societal impacts of delays in diagnosis are marked, with data suggesting CSU impacts up to 1% of the population, primarily of working age and with twice the prevalence in women. Herein, we advocate for the deployment of smartphone imaging and generative artificial intelligence technology to improve detection and early management of CSU through integrated self-care approaches. Such approaches embodying the tenets of P4 personalized medicine could have sustained impact on the disease through awareness campaigns, reducing the burden on the dermatology community and facilitating earlier access to curative therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have enabled multi-modal systems to model and translate diverse information spaces. Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal Deep Learning model for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data, rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates good performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute the most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reshaping microbiology, enabling rapid antibiotic discovery, resistance prediction and clinical diagnostics. For microbiologists, the goal is not to build new algorithms but to recognize when ML is appropriate, how to prepare data and how to interpret outputs responsibly. This primer takes that practical stance - driving the ML car rather than rebuilding the engine. At a high level, ML learns from complex patterns, often noisy data. In antibiotic discovery, ML models help identify compounds in biological data and design new ones from scratch using generative AI. In microbiome studies, where measurements are compositional, sparse and often confounded, ML helps uncover community structure and link taxa or functions to phenotypes. In pathogen genomics, supervised models map sequence-derived features (e.g. k‑mers, SNPs and gene presence/absence) to outcomes such as species identity, antimicrobial susceptibility or MIC. Unsupervised learning supports exploration, including clustering, latent gradients and dimensionality reduction for visualization. Across these settings, success hinges less on exotic architectures than on sound problem framing, careful preprocessing and experimental validation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually transforming healthcare. However, despite its promised benefits, AI in healthcare also raises a number of ethical, legal and social concerns. Compliance by design (CbD) has been proposed as one way of addressing some of these concerns. In the context of healthcare, CbD efforts could focus on building compliance with existing clinical guidelines (CGs), given that they provide the best practices identified according to evidence-based medicine. In this paper we use the example of AI-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to theoretically examine whether medical AI tools could be designed to be inherently compliant with CGs, and implication for ethics and trust. We argue that AI-based CDSS systematically complying with CGs when applied to specific patient cases are not desirable, as CGs, despite their usefulness in guiding medical decision-making, are only recommendations on how to diagnose and treat medical conditions. We thus propose a new understanding of CbD for CGs as a sociotechnical program supported by AI that applies to the whole clinical decision-making process rather than just understanding CbD for CGs as a process located only within the AI tool. This implies taking into account emerging knowledge from actual clinical practices to put CGs in perspective, reflexivity from users regarding the information needed for decision-making, as well as a shift in the design culture, from AI as a stand-alone tool to AI as an in-situ service located within particular healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic zonation reflects the concept that hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells (NPCs) perform distinct metabolic functions, depending on their spatial localization along the porto-central axis. The maintenance of this fine-tuned organization is essential for liver homeostasis, and its disruption may contribute to liver diseases, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Fat overload perturbs zonal gene signatures, lipid handling and oxygen/metabolite gradients progressively leading to steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis and HCC, conditions in which the hepatic architecture is lost. Traditional approaches have provided valuable insights into zonation, although they lack the spatial resolution and mask the heterogeneity of NPCs. Thus, the premise of this review is to discuss how spatial omics can redefine our understanding of hepatic zonation by integrating tissue mapping with metabolic organization, specifically focusing on MASLD. The advent of spatial omics accelerates knowledge regarding MASLD pathophysiology, providing more informative insights into transcriptional/translational/lipidomic/metabolomics zone-specific perturbations. Emerging spatial genomics and epigenomics applications further expand this scenario, allowing for the capture of chromatin remodeling in situ. The integration of these state-of-the-art approaches, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI)-based analyses, is promising in the clinic, as it may provide novel zonal prognostic biomarkers and pave the way for precision-medicine strategies targeting zonal switching.",

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled abnormal cell growth, referred to as cancer, can result in tumors, other fatal disabilities, and immune system deterioration. Typically, the treatment procedure is longer and extremely expensive owing to its higher recurrence and death rates. Early and precise detection and assessment of cancer are significant for improving patient survival rates. Moreover, initial cancer detection makes the treatment simpler and improves the rate of recovery, leading to a lower mortality rate. Gene expression data plays an important part in cancer classification at the initial phase. Precise cancer classification is a challenging and complex task because of the high-dimensional nature of gene expression data, coupled with the small sample size. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have recently developed fundamental models utilizing AI methods to diagnose and predict cancer. These techniques now play a leading role in increasing the precision of survival predictions, cancer susceptibility, and recurrence. This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence-Based Multimodal Approach for Cancer Genomics Diagnosis Using Optimized Significant Feature Selection Technique (AIMACGD-SFST) model. The aim is to develop precise and effective techniques for cancer genomics analysis using advanced computational and analytical techniques. The preprocessing stage comprises min-max normalization, handling missing values, encoding target labels, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Furthermore, the AIMACGD-SFST model employs the coati optimization algorithm (COA) method for feature selection process to choose the related features from the dataset. Finally, the ensemble models, namely deep belief network (DBN), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and variational stacked autoencoder (VSAE) are employed for the classification process. The experimental validation of the AIMACGD-SFST approach is performed under three diverse datasets. The comparison study of the AIMACGD-SFST approach illustrated superior accuracy value of 97.06%, 99.07%, and 98.55% over existing models under diverse datasets.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics offers critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of heart failure (HF) with reduced or preserved ejection fraction. However, understanding these mechanisms is hindered by the growing complexity of single-cell data and the difficulty in unmasking meaningful differential gene signatures among HF types. Machine learning, particularly deep neural networks (NNs), address these challenges by learning transcriptional patterns, reconstructing expression profiles and effectively classifying cells but often lacks interpretability. Recent advances in explainable AI (XAI) offer tools to clarify model decisions. Yet pinpointing differentially regulated genes with these tools remains challenging. We introduce a novel method to identify differentially explained genes (DXGs) based on importance scores derived from custom-built NNs. We highlight the superiority of DXGs in identifying HF subtypes-specific pathways that provide new insights into different types of HF. Offering a robust foundation for future research and therapeutic exploration in expanding transcriptome atlases.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, global political efforts have increasingly focused on the transformative potential of personalized medicine to prevent disease, improve health outcomes, and lower treatment costs. This has created at pressing demand for healthcare professionals to deepen their understanding and utilizing health data and its application in clinical decision-making. In response, a new master's program in personalized medicine has been launched across five universities in Denmark. This study, drawing on the sociology of expertise, investigates how educators and master's students in the program perceive and engage with the knowledge necessary for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into patient treatment and care. Our findings suggest a prevailing belief among educators in the potential of AI and big data to revolutionize healthcare by personalizing treatment options and improving diagnostic processes. Course participants generally acknowledged the ethical responsibility to leverage the vast amounts of data provided by patients to enhance treatment outcomes. However, some feared it might undermine the clinical insight they had gained through years of experience - insights they described as 'the art of medicine.' They navigated their agency and autonomy in the human-algorithm collaboration by framing algorithms as supportive additions to human judgment rather than replacements for it. In conclusion, this paper advocates for a more integrated approach that combines big data analysis with practical experience in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension (HTN) impacts approximately 1.28 billion individuals globally and poses a great burden of disease. The objectives of this study are to explore the role of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and artificial intelligence (AI) in the management of HTN. A thorough literature search was conducted across various databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science (WoS), and Medline to retrieve articles related to the role of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and AI in the precision medicine of HTN. Genes-including ACE, NOS3, ADD1, CYP11B2, NPPA, and NPPB-have a profound impact on blood pressure (BP) regulation in our body and polymorphism in these key genes can lead to HTN. Up or down-regulation of genes by epigenetic factors such as miRNA-155, miRNA-210, and miRNA-122 can significantly contribute to the development of HTN. These genetic and epigenetic factors can also be used as specific targets for gene editing and gene therapy for long-term management of HTN. However, the implementation of these techniques has not been possible in clinical settings due to lack of human studies and safety concerns related to unpredictable DNA alterations, nucleotide deletions, and loss of allele-specific chromosomes. Modulation of gut microbiome through oral supplements, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), and dietary interventions has emerged as one the most effective and safe techniques for managing HTN in human models. AI-based cutting-edge models have helped curate personalized diet plans based on an individual's unique microbiome, genomic information, and physiological conditions leading to a reduction in BMI, fat, BP, and heart rate while improving overall cardiac health and gut microbial diversity. Despite the significant advantages offered by AI-based medicine, ethical concerns-related to data privacy, bias, and discrimination-and ineffective models have led to limited integration of AI in precision medicine of HTN. The integration of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and AI-based models can play a key role in improving the current landscape of precision medicine of HTN. These cutting-edge techniques can lead to a shift from the current one-size-fits all approach to more personalized treatment plan however further research in human models is needed to determine the safety and true efficacy of these techniques. Additionally, new AI-models need to be developed that address ethical concerns and are effective in real-world clinical settings.",

The paper also analyzes the major challenges faced by LLM agents, such as the interaction and extension of their frameworks, data privacy and security, model hallucinations and interpretability, timeliness of knowledge updates, and ethical and legal risks. Furthermore, we discuss future directions, including paradigms for human-artificial intelligence collaboration and the development of open-source ecosystems and standardization. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive perspective and guidance on the advancement of LLM agents in bioinformatics and biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "The world is currently facing an unprecedented convergence of crises that threaten the core pillars of public health, scientific integrity, and social stability. These challenges are profoundly interconnected and have the potential to exacerbate global inequalities, jeopardize health security, and undermine the progress achieved through decades of international collaboration. Our viewpoint declaration, developed by 366 healthcare workers and scientists from 119 countries across six continents, highlights the urgent need for global solidarity and collective action to address these interconnected global health challenges. As healthcare workers and scientists, we must prioritize the protection of scientific integrity, combat political interference, and restore public trust in the scientific process. This will require a commitment to transparency, ethical responsibility, and evidence-based decision-making that can stand strong in the face of political and social adversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of resilient healthcare systems, emphasizing that preparedness, capacity building and coherent leadership and coordination are essential for future global health crises. In addition, our call for a One Health approach, acknowledging the intricate relationship between human, animal, and environmental health, has never been more pressing, especially as zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance spread across borders. As we confront ongoing wars, environmental destruction, and global persistent health inequalities, it is only through unity, solidarity, collaboration, and innovation that we hope to build a healthier, more equitable world. Together, we must ensure that science and medicine remain a force for good, capable of addressing both the immediate and long-term needs and challenges facing our shared future.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the accuracy and reliability of six large language models (LLMs)-three Chinese (Doubao, Kimi, DeepSeek) and three international (ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro, Grok3)-in radiology, using simulated questions from the 2025 Chinese Radiology Attending Physician Qualification Examination (CRAPQE). Analysis covered 400 CRAPQE-simulated questions, spanning various formats (A1, A2-A4, B, C-type) and modalities (text-only, image-based). Expert radiologists scored responses against official answer keys. Performance comparisons within and between Chinese and international LLM groups assessed overall, unit-specific, question-type-specific, and modality-specific accuracy. All LLMs passed the CRAPQE simulation, showing proficiency comparable to a radiology attending. Chinese LLMs achieved a higher mean accuracy (87.2%) than international LLMs (80.4%, P < 0.05), excelling in text-only and A1-type questions (P < 0.05). DeepSeek (91.6%) and Doubao (89.5%) outperformed Kimi (80.5%, P < 0.0167), while international LLMs showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). All models surpassed the passing threshold on image-based questions but performed worse than on text questions, with no group difference (P > 0.05). This pioneering comparison highlights the potential of LLMs in radiology, with Chinese models outperforming their international counterparts, likely due to localized training, providing evidence to guide the development of medical AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping medical diagnostics, and nephrology - characterized by multifactorial disease patterns - stands to benefit markedly. Machine‑learning and deep‑learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and large language models (LLMs), can analyze heterogeneous data streams from electronic health records, imaging, histopathology and genomics to support diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic planning. AI‑driven automation of routine workflows (e.g., appointment scheduling, NLP‑based documentation, chatbot‑guided anamneses) enables clinicians to focus on complex decision‑making, while real‑time decision‑support tools can integrate laboratory, imaging and guideline data. Recent advances include CNN‑based detection of renal lesions, deep‑learning prognostic scores for IgA nephropathy, and AI‑enhanced variant calling (e.g., DeepVariant). Nevertheless, challenges persist: data bias, limited external validation, \"hallucinations\" of LLMs, regulatory compliance (MDR, GDPR), and the need for transparent, locally hosted models. Successful implementation requires interoperable, FHIR‑compatible data, robust training of staff, and integration of AI education into medical education. With this, AI promises substantial efficiency gains, improved diagnostic precision, and sustained care quality in nephrology.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical workflows is advancing even before full compliance with the European Union Cross-Border eHealth Network (MyHealth@EU) framework is achieved. While AI-based clinical decision support systems are automatically classified as high risk under the European Union's AI Act, cross-border health data exchange must also satisfy MyHealth@EU interoperability requirements. This creates a dual-compliance challenge: vertical safety and ethics controls mandated by the AI Act and horizontal semantic transport requirements enforced through Open National Contact Point (OpenNCP) gateways, many of which are still maturing toward production readiness. This paper provides a practical, phase-oriented tutorial that enables developers and providers to embed AI Act safeguards before approaching MyHealth@EU interoperability tests. The goal is to show how AI-specific metadata can be included in the Health Level Seven International Clinical Document Architecture and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources messages without disrupting standard structures, ensuring both compliance and trustworthiness in AI-assisted clinical decisions. We systematically analyzed Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (AI Act) and the OpenNCP technical specifications, extracting a harmonized set of overlapping obligations. The AI Act provisions on transparency, provenance, and robustness are mapped directly onto MyHealth@EU workflows, identifying the points where outgoing messages must record AI involvement, log provenance, and trigger validation. To operationalize this mapping, we propose a minimal extension set, covering AI contribution status, rationale, risk classification, and Annex IV documentation links, together with a phase-based compliance checklist that aligns AI Act controls with MyHealth@EU conformance steps. A simulated International Patient Summary transmission demonstrates how Clinical Document Architecture/Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources extensions can annotate AI involvement, how OpenNCP processes such enriched payloads, and how clinicians in another member state view the result with backward compatibility preserved. We expand on security considerations (eg, Open Worldwide Application Security Project generative AI risks such as prompt injection and adversarial inputs), continuous postmarket risk assessment, monitoring, and alignment with MyHealth@EU's incident aggregation system. Limitations reflect the immaturity of current infrastructures and regulations, with real-world validation pending the rollout of key dependencies. AI-enabled clinical software succeeds only when AI Act safeguards and MyHealth@EU interoperability rules are engineered together from day 0. This tutorial provides developers with a forward-looking blueprint that reduces duplication of effort, streamlines conformance testing, and embeds compliance early. While the concept is still in its early phases of practice, it represents a necessary and worthwhile direction for ensuring that future AI-enabled clinical systems can meet both European Union regulatory requirements from day 1., risks such as prompt injection and adversarial inputs), continuous postmarket risk assessment, monitoring, and alignment with MyHealth@EU's incident aggregation system. Limitations reflect the immaturity of current infrastructures and regulations, with real-world validation pending the rollout of key dependencies.",

    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining attention in rheumatology, little is known about patient perspectives. This study addresses this gap by examining patients' experiences and attitudes toward AI. A nationwide, cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between March and May 2025 among adult patients with rheumatic diseases in Germany. Data were analyzed descriptively and with cluster analysis. A total of 778 patients completed the survey (70.4% female, mean age 51.3 years). The most common diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis (31.7%). While 26.8% reported current AI use for health-related purposes, 57.8% expressed interest in using it. Patients were particularly interested in AI-based symptom checkers (64.3%), therapy recommendations (50.6%), and chatbots for medical inquiries (44.5%). 57.6% of patients indicated that they would welcome their rheumatologists using AI-based clinical suppport. The most frequently cited benefits of AI included improved information access (63.5%) and faster diagnosis (57.7%), while concerns centered on faulty AI (74.3%) and reduced human interaction (59.6%). Cluster analysis identified three distinct patient profiles: 'AI-savvy' (41.4%), 'AI-pragmatic' (44.8%), and 'AI-skeptical' (13.8%). Cluster membership was significantly associated with age and education, with younger patients more often belonging to the 'AI-savvy' group. Patients with rheumatic diseases showed substantial interest in AI-supported care, although actual use in medical contexts remained limited. Age and education differences highlight the need for tailored implementation strategies to ensure equitable and patient-centered adoption of AI in rheumatology.",

    "abstract": "Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a clinically heterogeneous endocrine disorder whose management has historically been guided by biochemical profiles and symptomatic presentation. However, the limitations of conventional diagnostic and therapeutic strategies-including poor sensitivity in detecting subclinical organ damage and an inability to predict disease progression-have underscored the need for a more nuanced, biomarker-driven approach. Recent advances in multi-omics technologies, functional imaging, and artificial intelligence have enabled the emergence of precision medicine paradigms for PHPT. This review synthesizes evidence on the role of multilevel biomarkers-spanning genetic, epigenetic, non-coding RNA, metabolic, and imaging domains-in refining risk stratification and guiding individualized treatment. We further propose an integrated framework that combines dynamic biomarker profiling with multidisciplinary team (MDT)-based decision-making to facilitate personalized intervention pathways-from surgical planning to long-term surveillance. Despite promising developments, clinical translation remains challenged by the lack of standardized biomarker validation and integrative analytical platforms. Future efforts should prioritize collaborative networks and large-scale prospective studies to establish evidence-based guidelines for implementing precision medicine in PHPT.",

    "abstract": "Heavy metal (HM) contamination in agricultural soils threatens food security, soil health, and human well-being. While phytoremediation offers a sustainable alternative to conventional remediation methods, its efficiency remains limited. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and multiomics technologies (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) provide transformative opportunities to overcome these limitations. This review highlights the integration of AI-driven models with multiomics data to optimize phytoremediation strategies. AI enables the prediction of plant-microbe interactions, selection of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), and modeling of metal transporter dynamics, thereby enhancing crop tolerance and metal accumulation. By mining large-scale omics datasets, AI can also identify critical pathways for detoxification and guide precision engineering of plants and microbes. The convergence of AI, ML, and multi-omics technologies represents a transformative approach to solving the challenge of heavy metal pollution in soils. This integrated framework not only accelerates the development of metal-resistant crops but also paves the way for a new era of precision remediation, where tailored, data-driven solutions could revolutionize soil decontamination and lead to more sustainable and resilient agricultural practices.",

    "abstract": "Future research on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins is essential for advancing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and control amid rising drug resistance and global health challenges. Recent studies focus on elucidating protein structures and interactions critical to bacterial survival, virulence, and drug resistance, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Cutting-edge technologies such as single-cell proteomics, cryo-electron microscopy, and spatial proteomics provide unprecedented resolution of protein localization, dynamics, and host-pathogen interactions. Posttranslational modifications and dynamic proteomic profiling reveal bacterial adaptive mechanisms, while integrative multi-omics combined with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning accelerate functional annotation and predictive modeling. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-based functional genomics complements these approaches by enabling precise gene regulation studies. Advances in AI-powered diagnostics and genomic surveillance are transforming TB detection and drug resistance profiling, improving patient outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Overall, integrating experimental and computational innovations promises to deepen understanding of Mtb biology, accelerate drug discovery, enhance diagnostics, and ultimately contribute to global efforts in combating tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies and multi-omics approaches has led to rapid accumulation of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and even single-cell multimodal datasets, resulting in an exponential growth of biological data. The massive scale and inherent complexity of these datasets pose significant challenges for data management, analysis, and interpretation in the field of bioinformatics. Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning, have achieved groundbreaking advances in medical diagnostics, drug discovery, and genomic analyses, providing novel theoretical tools and analytical paradigms for bioinformatics research. AI techniques are now extensively applied to DNA, RNA, and protein sequence prediction and design, 3D structural elucidation, functional annotation, integrative analysis of multi-omics data, and personalized drug design for precision medicine, significantly advancing biological research. This review systematically summarizes recent research progress and representative applications of AI techniques in bioinformatics, specifically discussing suitable scenarios and advantages of traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and reinforcement learning methods. We highlight AI's transformative impact with quantitative metrics from landmark achievements: accurate near-atomic protein structure prediction (median 0.96 Å on CASP14), robust single-cell modeling (AvgBIO $\\approx $ 0.82), high protein design success rates (up to 92%), and sensitive cancer detection (Area Under Curve (AUC) $\\approx $ 0.93). Furthermore, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of the latest advancements of AI in specific tasks, including biomedical text mining, multimodal omics integration, and single-cell analyses, while highlighting current challenges such as data noise and sparsity, difficulties in modeling long biological sequences, complexities in multimodal data integration, insufficient model interpretability, and ethical and privacy concerns. Finally, the paper outlines promising future research directions, emphasizing large-scale data mining, cross-domain model generalization, innovations in drug design and personalized medicine, and advocates for establishing an open and collaborative research ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Public health increasingly relies on digital infrastructures, yet data remains fragmented across clinical, behavioral, and social domains. Customer Data Platforms (CDPs), originally created in marketing to unify diverse information into dynamic individual profiles, could provide a new approach for person-centered public health. This article explores the strategic potential of applying CDP principles, such as data unification, identity resolution, segmentation, and timely intervention, to enhance surveillance, prevention, and chronic disease management. A conceptual framework is presented and demonstrated through a breast cancer screening scenario, illustrating how CDPs could enable personalized outreach and integration with artificial intelligence (AI). Although promising, there are significant challenges related to privacy, interoperability, fairness, and governance. Responsible deployment requires socio-technical strategies that emphasize transparency, ethical oversight, and person involvement.",

This review systematically summarizes recent research advancements and breakthrough achievements in the application of synthetic biology in the genetic improvement of rice, focusing on three critical domains: yield improvement, nutritional quality fortification, and reinforcement of disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance. It elucidates that synthetic biology enables precise genomic and metabolic pathway engineering through modular, standard, and systematic approaches, effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional breeding methods characterized by prolonged cycles and restricted trait modification capabilities. The implementation of synthetic biology has facilitated synergistic improvement of multi-traits, thereby providing critical technical references for developing elite rice cultivars with superior productivity and nutritional value.

    "abstract": "Physicians face a significant documentation burden, spending twice as much time on electronic health records (EHRs) as on direct patient care. Consultation summary reports from the emergency department (ED) are critical for continuity of care and clinical decision-making. This study aims to evaluate the quality and utility of automatically generated neurological consultation reports with clear recommendations, while reducing neurologists' documentation burden. We used neurological consultation reports (n = 250) from the ED as reference outputs. For each case, we fed the report's constituent components into the large language model (LLM). Using prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate auto-summarized reports, which were then compared against the original consultation reports. The Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and semantic embedding (Clinical-BioBert) were used as performance metrics. The LLM-generated report exhibited high semantic similarity with the neurologist's report (0.89 ± 0.03). However, significant differences in report length were observed, with LLM-generated reports being more concise than those written by attending neurologists (61.56 vs. 94.75 words, p < 0.001). Additionally, LLM-generated reports were written in a more straightforward and accessible style (FKGL = 11.3 vs. 12.22, p < 0.001). Despite these strengths, the LLM-generated reports exhibited substantial divergence in writing style from neurologists' reports (ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.25, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.09, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.19). LLM-generated neurological consultation reports demonstrate strong semantic alignment with human-authored reports while offering a more concise and accessible format. Notable differences in writing style suggest a standardized approach that, while effective in conveying clinical content, may lack the personalization of neurologist-written reports.",

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in the progression and therapeutic resistance of HCC. Interventional therapies have emerged as pivotal modalities in the treatment of liver cancer, especially in cases that are unsuitable for surgical resection. The evolution of these techniques has been markedly enhanced by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which has the potential to increase precision, improve outcomes, and personalize patient care. This review covers modern interventional therapies for liver cancer, highlighting recent advances in minimally invasive procedures. It describes the intricate liver TME and emphasizes the importance of characterizing its diversity and identifying therapeutic targets. Additionally, we discuss how AI can decipher TME complexities, predict responses, categorize patients, and personalize treatments. By elucidating connections between the TME, therapeutic interventions, and AI, this review aims to improve the management and care of patients with liver cancer.",

While the virtual hospital-at-home model offers the potential to improve patient-centered care and health equity, rapid implementation often overlooks culturally diverse and underserved populations, including South Asian communities who experience disproportionate chronic disease burden and barriers to accessing culturally relevant services.

    "abstract": "Remote robotic surgery (RRS) represents a frontier in surgical innovation, integrating robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-speed communication networks. Despite its clinical significance, the global research landscape and conceptual evolution of RRS remain insufficiently mapped. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 857 Scopus-indexed documents (1980-2025) was conducted using Bibliometrix (R-package), VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. Analyses covered descriptive trends, country productivity, citation impact, collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence, Bradford's Law of journal concentration, CiteSpace co-citation clustering, and thematic evolution. Thematic mapping was performed using the Walktrap clustering algorithm (250 words, minimum cluster frequency = 5) to visualize conceptual structures and developmental trajectories. RRS research exhibited an annual growth rate of 10.35%, with strong international collaboration (26.96%). The United States, China, Japan, and France dominated global contributions. Keyword co-occurrence and CiteSpace clustering revealed five thematic domains-robotic systems, telemedicine integration, surgical innovation, AI-assisted imaging, and 5G-enabled connectivity. Bradford's Law identified a small core of specialized journals as primary publication outlets. Thematic evolution (1980-2025) indicated three conceptual eras: foundational simulation and telepresence (1980-2013), technological integration with 5G and AI (2014-2022), and intelligent convergence emphasizing deep learning, blockchain, and ultra-low-latency communication (2023-2025). Thematic mapping further highlighted telesurgery as a basic theme and surgery as a motor theme driving interdisciplinary expansion. This bibliometric synthesis reveals a paradigm shift from early teleoperation frameworks to AI-driven, 5G-powered, and cybersecure surgical ecosystems. Future research should prioritize real-time data fusion, robotic autonomy, and ethical frameworks guiding intelligent telesurgical networks.",

    "abstract": "Risk stratification remains a critical challenge in non-small cell lung cancer patients for optimal therapy selection. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-powered spatial cellomics approach that combines histology, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging and multimodal machine learning to characterize the complex cellular relationships of 43 cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment in a real-world retrospective cohort of 1168 non-small cell lung cancer patients from two large German cancer centers. The model identifies cell niches associated with survival and achieves a 14% and 47% improvement in risk stratification in the two main non-small cell lung cancer subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, combining niche patterns with conventional cancer staging. Our results show that complex immune cell niche patterns identify potentially undertreated high-risk patients qualifying for adjuvant therapy. Our approach highlights the potential of artificial intelligence powered multiplex imaging analyses to better understand the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to cancer progression and to improve risk stratification and treatment selection in non-small cell lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "The PIRP Project (Progressive Renal Insufficiency Prevention), launched in Emilia-Romagna in the early 2000s, was created to establish a network between general practitioners and nephrologists aimed at the early identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD), slowing its progression, and improving clinical outcomes. The project included several phases: a training phase for general practitioners, the establishment of dedicated outpatient clinics, and the creation of a regional electronic registry, which today includes more than 38,000 patients. The results have shown a reduction in CKD progression, fewer urgent dialysis starts, and better control of comorbidities. PIRP differs from the national PDTA for CKD in its operational and regional approach, based on real-world data and multidisciplinary co-management, whereas the PDTA represents a general regulatory framework. The project has developed predictive models (such as CT-PIRP), inspired comparative European studies, and today stands as a model of integrated healthcare, useful for the implementation of nephroprotective drugs and artificial intelligence. Twenty years after its inception, PIRP remains an example of proactive and collaborative medicine, anticipating modern paradigms of population health management.",

    "abstract": "The promising integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) or AI chatbots, into medical education and practice necessitates rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. While chatbot performance has been assessed against standardized exams like the bar, medical and dental boards, and in diagnostic specialties such as radiology and ophthalmology, a critical gap exists within the complex discipline of pathology, specifically concerning subspecialty areas like head and neck pathology. Conducting a pilot study evaluating chatbot responses to head and neck pathology board-style questions is therefore essential and novel. Crucially for education, this pilot study evaluated six AI chatbots on their performance in answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) retrieved from authorities in the field of head and neck pathology. Twenty MCQs relevant to head and neck pathology were identified from the public domain. A total of 120 responses from six chatbots were evaluated for response and citation accuracy. Although AI chatbots answered head and neck pathology board-style questions with 85-100% accuracy, citation accuracy and performance on image-based questions were poor. Considering the pedagogical principle that actively challenging exam questions enhances memory retention and learning outcomes compared to passive text review, AI-generated multiple-choice questions specifically designed for head and neck pathology study revision purposes were generated. The generated MCQs were determined to be at a more fundamental level and suitable for predoctoral dental students or first-year pathology residents. This pilot study probed the limitations of these tools in accurately addressing diagnostic and interpretive challenges. Furthermore, the recommendations and guidelines informed from the results of this pilot study represent a vital first step in the addressing the responsible use of AI for head and neck pathology education and practice.",

Predictive analytics that assimilate intra-operative metrics with early postoperative information can forecast survival and complication profiles, thereby supporting tailored follow-up protocols. Remaining barriers include safeguarding data privacy, accelerating image-registration and inference speeds, meeting high computational-resource demands and offsetting the substantial capital and maintenance costs of these systems. Nevertheless, the convergent evolution of artificial intelligence and real-time imaging navigation is poised to transform radical gastrectomy by elevating surgical precision, enhancing patient safety and improving long-term outcomes; realizing this promise will require algorithmic refinement, multicenter validation, robust ethical frameworks and cost-effective implementation models.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatitis poses persistent diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation, variable disease course, and lack of targeted interventions. Conventional tools, such as serum enzymes, cross-sectional imaging and clinical scoring systems, often exhibit limited sensitivity and prognostic value, especially during early or atypical stages. Moreover, therapeutic development remains slow, with limited progress toward personalized or mechanism-based strategies. These limitations highlight a critical need for integrative data-driven approaches. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance clinical decision-making in pancreatitis. This narrative review synthesizes recent progress in AI applications across three domains. First, AI-enabled diagnostic platforms incorporating radiomics, deep learning-based imaging analysis, and biomarker optimization have improved early detection and differentiation of pancreatic diseases. Second, AI-driven prognostic models now allow real-time severity prediction, complication forecasting, and recurrence risk assessment, some of which have been deployed in hospital information systems for intensive care units and mortality risk triage. Third, AI-assisted drug discovery and network pharmacology, particularly in combination with traditional Chinese medicine, have revealed novel therapeutic opportunities. Despite encouraging developments, challenges remain in data standardization, model transparency and clinical validation. A multidisciplinary strategy integrating omics data, longitudinal monitoring and pharmacological modeling may help bridge current gaps and advance precision medicine in pancreatitis care.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases. In clinical practice AI consists of overlapping technologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and generative AI. ML is a computer learning system that can provide insight into disease risk factors and phenotypes. Deep learning is an advanced and complex form of ML, structured with different levels of specific algorithms known as convolutional neural networks that can rapidly and accurately process unstructured, high-dimensional data, such as texts, images, and waveforms. Natural language processing is dedicated to facilitating interactions between computers and humans using natural language and helps to analyze, understand, and derive actionable information from unstructured healthcare data, including electronic health records, clinical notes, medical literature, and patient-generated content. Computer vision focuses on enabling computers to see and interpret images and videos and serves as an augmentation tool for endoscopists, improving accuracy and decreasing procedural time.

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a major global health concern, significantly impacting patient quality of life and healthcare systems. Mucosal and histological healing have emerged as key therapeutic targets, offering better long-term outcomes compared with previous targets. However, accurate disease assessment remains challenging because of interobserver variability and inconsistencies between endoscopic and histological findings. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming IBD care by enhancing the precision and reproducibility of disease evaluation. This review provided a structured synthesis of AI applications in IBD, organized by diagnostic, histological, and therapeutic domains, and highlighted comparative model performance such as machine learning classifiers (random forest, support vector machine) and deep learning models (convolutional and recurrent neural networks) with reported accuracy between 80% and 97% and areas under the curve ranging from 0.74 to 0.99. Beyond summarizing existing tools, the review emphasized the ability of AI to reduce diagnostic variability, improve early prediction of therapeutic response, and streamline clinical workflows. These advancements support a shift toward personalized treatment strategies and more efficient care delivery. Additionally, we outlined the expanding role of AI in clinical trials in which it supports patient stratification, endpoint prediction, and automated data integration.",

    "abstract": "Hepatology encompasses various aspects, such as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, liver failure, liver tumors, and liver transplantation. The global epidemiological situation of liver diseases is grave, posing a substantial threat to human health and quality of life. Characterized by high incidence and mortality rates, liver diseases have emerged as a prominent global public health concern. In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and radiomics has transformed medical research and clinical practice, demonstrating considerable potential in hepatology. AI is capable of automatically detecting abnormal cells in liver tissue sections, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of pathological diagnosis. Deep learning models are able to extract features from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging images to facilitate liver disease classification. Machine learning models are capable of integrating clinical data to forecast disease progression and treatment responses, thus supporting clinical decision-making for personalized medicine. Through the analysis of imaging data, laboratory results, and genomic information, AI can assist in diagnosis, forecast disease progression, and optimize treatment plans, thereby improving clinical outcomes for liver disease patients. This minireview intends to comprehensively summarize the state-of-the-art theories and applications of AI in hepatology, explore the opportunities and challenges it presents in clinical practice, basic research, and translational medicine, and propose future research directions to guide the advancement of hepatology and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Traditional knowledge on health has long contributed to global health-care systems. Rooted in the cultural and ecological heritage of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, traditional knowledge has influenced pharmaceutical research, biodiversity conservation and public health strategies. However, concerns over misappropriation of traditional knowledge and inadequate benefit-sharing with the sources of such knowledge persist. The World Intellectual Property Organization Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge mandates patent disclosure requirements for genetic resources and traditional knowledge. While a step forward, the treaty's success depends on its effective implementation, ethical documentation of traditional knowledge, governance of artificial intelligence and equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms, among other factors. We examine traditional knowledge protection under intellectual property systems, the provisions of the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty, challenges to documentation of traditional knowledge and the role of artificial intelligence in the governance of traditional knowledge. By fostering a legally robust and technology-driven protection system for traditional knowledge, policy-makers can ensure that traditional knowledge remains both a protected cultural heritage and a resource for sustainable innovation in global health.",

    "abstract": "The aspirations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) precision medicine and precision brain health are not fully realized despite significant advances in early pathological detection. Hampering progress is the difficult challenge of the accurate detection of behavioral symptoms that can help differentiate those at high risk specific to AD versus those with more AD and related dementias (ADRD), who may have AD along with other types of dementia, as well as those who will and will not progress to clinically expressed disease. Technological advances in hardware, software, and analytics are paving the way to opportunities to overcome these long-standing barriers to early clinical symptom detection, when recent and emerging interventions might be most effective. It is important to note that these innovations must not exist in isolation. Integration of data from both AD/ADRD related studies and non-AD related studies is needed whenever brain-related measures are collected to fully realize the scientific opportunities. We envision a near future of harmonized participant data sharing, encompassing standardized multimodal data alongside emerging digital streams, to deliver an invaluable resource for the global research community. HIGHLIGHTS: Technology is overcoming barriers to accurate early detection of behavioral symptoms of AD/ADRD. The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center is paving the way for the integration of technological advances into AD/ADRD research. A technologically-enabled framework provides a solution for open science on a global scale.",

Forensic psychiatrists must consider its utility specific to the forensic population, and requirements for its safe and ethical implementation. In this narrative review, we consider how AI has the potential to assist clinical forensic psychiatry with diagnosis and risk assessment, and the practical, ethical and legal challenges to overcome. Early research shows potential for the use of AI in screening and identification of mental disorders, but with significant limitations and little consideration of forensic populations. More research has been done in the area of offending risk assessment, but clinical utility is limited by external validation and differentiation of offence type predicted. Practical and ethical challenges identified include obtaining the large volumes of representative training data required from various sources, heterogeneity of diagnostic constructs, lack of transparency as to how models develop outputs and the reliability of them, and the propagation of bias. We conclude by recommending increased data collection and sharing across agencies, external validation of AI models, enhanced clinician training and involvement in development of AI tools, and the development of ethical and legal safeguards and regulations on the use of AI in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Bone fracture continues to pose a significant clinical challenge in regenerative medicine due to limited repair capacity and inadequate therapeutic options. Among the various therapeutic strategies, mesenchymal stem cells have shown strong potential due to their ability to promote bone formation, modulate inflammation, and migrate to injury sites. However, clinical outcomes have been limited by issues like low survival rates, poor integration, and non-specific distribution after transplantation. Functionalized mesenchymal cells enhanced through genetic, chemical, or material-based modifications have emerged as an advanced strategy to overcome these limitations and significantly improve bone regeneration. This review explores recent developments in the functionalization of stem cells to increase their bone-forming potential. It covers techniques of gene modification, preconditioning, nanoparticle integration, and scaffold-based delivery. The role of these engineered cells is in activating key pathways involved in bone repair, including bone morphogenetic proteins and Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the study highlights current delivery platforms, including injectable gels, printed scaffolds, and bioactive coatings that support targeted, sustained cell activity. Despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, unresolved challenges in manufacturing, immune compatibility, and regulatory pathways persist, prompting the exploration of emerging solutions like precision-engineered implants and artificial intelligence-driven design to guide the future of advanced bone regeneration therapies.",

    "abstract": "Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs broadly distributed in eukaryotes, are emerging as pivotal regulators in the field of epigenomics. In addition to guiding 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation modifications at specific rRNA sites to maintain ribosomal stability and support protein synthesis, snoRNAs have been increasingly implicated in epigenetic regulation, influencing gene expression, chromatin architecture, and RNA modification patterns. Accurate identification of potential snoRNA-disease associations (SDAs) is therefore essential for understanding epigenomic dysregulation in complex diseases and facilitating early intervention and drug repurposing. Although artificial intelligence (AI) methods have advanced SDA prediction, they are still hindered by issues such as sample imbalance and high false-negative rates. To address these challenges, we propose ESAE-SDA, a novel model integrating sparse autoencoders with an ensemble learning framework. ESAE-SDA first constructs a comprehensive snoRNA-disease representation using multi-source similarity metrics. It then applies k-means clustering to select high-confidence negative samples and employs a deep sparse autoencoder with sparsity constraints to learn compact, discriminative embeddings. Finally, multiple GNN-based learners are independently trained on dynamically resampled data, and ensemble inference is performed via weighted fusion, substantially enhancing robustness and generalization. Experiments on a public SDA dataset demonstrate that ESAE-SDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, a case study on ophthalmic diseases highlights the model's ability to uncover epigenetically relevant snoRNAs with potential regulatory and therapeutic significance, underscoring its value in epigenomics-driven disease research and target discovery.",

    "abstract": "Osborne fractionation remains a cornerstone in food science for categorizing seed storage proteins (SSPs), yet molecular distinctions among the classes remain unclear. This study employs a computational framework integrating structural modeling, AI (artificial intelligence)-driven classification, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate these underlying physicochemical differences. Using a dataset of 1039 SSPs from 215 species, sequence and structural-based features were extracted and compared to identify class-specific characteristics, such as low hydrophobic patch area of albumins. Machine learning (ML) classifiers, including binary support vector machines and graph convolutional networks were trained on these features, achieving validation and test accuracies ranging from 96.0 % to 100.0 %. Model interpretations using SHapley Additive exPlanations and saliency mapping revealed key distinguishing features between albumin/prolamin and globulin/glutelin, respectively. For the albumin and prolamin classes, physicochemical feature comparisons and ML classifiers identified factors underlying their solubility differences, such as the low abundance of charged residues in prolamins. On the other hand, although certain features, such as mean surface electric potential, distinguished globulins from glutelins, no clear association was found between these features and experimental solubility trend. Notably, saliency analysis of globulins and glutelins highlighted loop and helical regions outside the conserved β-barrel motifs, where compositional differences in glutamic acid, glycine, serine, and glutamine residues were observed. MD simulations explored solvent-specific conformational changes in representative SSPs, with all-atomic simulations performed on single monomers and coarse-grained simulations conducted with multiple monomers. For 2S soy albumin and 19 kDa maize prolamin, distinct hydrogen bonding patterns was observed during their adaptations to 70 % ethanol environment, and the expected aggregation tendency was reproduced in the multiple-monomer simulation. Taken together with the highlighted features in ML classification, these results suggest that the experimental solubility of albumins and prolamins can be explained at the monomeric level. However, for pea legumin A (globulin) and rice glutelin A1, no clear differences in structural and aggregation dynamics were observed, and monomeric properties alone failed to account for their distinct solubility. These findings suggest that glutelin insolubility is likely dictated by inter-protein disulfide networks rather than intrinsic monomeric characteristics, aligning with previous experimental observations.",

Among the existing computational docking methods, Python docking (pyDock) has shown competitive predictive rates and high robustness over the years. However, the field has dramatically changed with the appearance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, like AlphaFold. While structure prediction of individual proteins is virtually solved by this program, the focus is now on how to improve the prediction of challenging cases like antibody-antigen complexes, multiprotein complexes, weak interactions, or highly flexible interacting proteins. Successful strategies are based on the generation of more diverse sets of models and the integration with other \"classical\" approaches that facilitate the identification of the correct models. Here, we will show in practical terms how to combine the structural modeling capabilities of AlphaFold with the energy-based scoring function in pyDock to improve structural predictions in challenging protein-protein complexes.",

This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and advances in clinical and translational research in Endodontics, addressing methodological foundations, diagnostic challenges, and emerging technologies. It highlights the importance of well-designed randomized controlled trials, robust outcome definitions, and the inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures. The integration of advanced imaging, particularly cone-beam computed tomography, has significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment monitoring. Molecular biology techniques, including polymerase chain reaction and biomarker profiling, have expanded the understanding of endodontic microbiome, immune responses, and host factors related to treatment outcomes. Despite these advances, persistent limitations include diagnostic imprecision, lack of standardized criteria, and underutilization of biomarkers and omics data in clinical practice. The rise of precision dentistry, propelled by genomics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, holds the potential to revolutionize endodontic care through personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Bridging existing gaps will require rigorous study designs, coordinated multicenter efforts, and the effective integration of molecular diagnostics, all of which are critical to advancing endodontic science and optimizing patient outcomes. Likewise, the full potential of translational science can be harnessed to reshape the future of endodontics.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of generative large language models (LLMs) necessitates a fundamental reevaluation of traditional didactic lectures in medical education, particularly within psychiatry. The specialty's inherent diagnostic ambiguity, biopsychosocial complexity, and reliance on nuanced interpersonal skills demand an educational model that transcends mere information transfer, focusing instead on cultivating sophisticated clinical reasoning. This viewpoint argues for a shift from passive knowledge transmission to active, facilitated development of higher-order thinking, aligning with the Bloom taxonomy. We describe four core propositions: (1) shifting foundational knowledge acquisition to faculty-curated asynchronous artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted micromodules; (2) transforming synchronous time into \"Ambiguity Seminars\" for discussing nuanced cases, biopsychosocial formulation, and ethical dilemmas, leveraging faculty expertise in guiding reasoning; (3) integrating live LLM critical interaction drills to develop prompt engineering skills and critical appraisal of AI outputs; and (4) realigning assessment methods (eg, objective structured clinical examinations [OSCEs], reflective writing) to evaluate clinical reasoning and integrative skills rather than rote recall. Successful implementation requires comprehensive faculty development, explicit institutional investment, and a phased approach that addresses scalability across varying resource settings. This reimagined approach aims to cultivate clinical wisdom, equipping psychiatric trainees with adaptive reasoning frameworks essential for excellence in an AI-mediated future.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly revolutionizing the landscape of oncological research and the advancement of personalized clinical interventions. Progress in three interconnected areas, including the development of methods and algorithms for training AI models, the evolution of specialized computing hardware, and increased access to large volumes of cancer data such as imaging, genomics, and clinical information, has converged, leading to promising new applications of AI in cancer research. AI applications are systematically organized according to specific cancer types and clinical domains, encompassing the elucidation and prediction of biological mechanisms, the identification and utilization of patterns within clinical data to improve patient outcomes, and the unraveling of the complexities inherent in epidemiological, behavioral, and real-world datasets. When applied in an ethical and scientifically rigorous manner, these AI-driven approaches hold the promise of accelerating progress in cancer research and ultimately fostering improved health outcomes for all populations. We review examples demonstrating the integration of AI within oncology, highlighting cases where deep learning has adeptly addressed challenges once deemed insurmountable, while also discussing the barriers that must be surmounted to facilitate broader adoption of these technologies.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaques are complex and heterogeneous structures, originating as fatty streaks in the vasculature and formed by the accumulation of lipids and foam cells. Over time, these lesions progress as inflammation, smooth muscle cell proliferation and phenotypic switching, and extracellular matrix deposition contribute to plaque growth, culminating in their fracture, reactive thrombogenesis, and a cardiovascular event such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Traditional bulk mass spectrometry (MS) analysis has yielded critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of plaque formation and disease progression, but it is unable to determine the spatial heterogeneity and microenvironmental complexity within the lesion. Recent advances in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) based omics, including spatial lipidomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have enabled unprecedented visualization of molecular distribution in atherosclerotic plaques at cellular resolution. These techniques promise to elucidate the distinct cellular crosstalk, lesion vulnerability, and sex-specific disease mechanisms that contribute to plaque development and rupture. This review examines the recent advances in MS-based spatial omics and their application to atherosclerotic plaques in both experimental models and human samples. We highlight recent findings, explore their implications for precision medicine and translational research, and discuss current challenges in sample preparation and data integration. Despite challenges, we suggest approaches for integration of MS-based spatial omics using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance data integration, interpretation, and translational applications in atherosclerosis research. These advances promise to broaden our understanding of atherosclerosis and identify novel therapeutic targets to limit the burden of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.",

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.",

    "abstract": "As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of extreme events such as wildfires, the need for accurate, explainable, and actionable forecasting becomes increasingly urgent. While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning.",

    "abstract": "Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

    "abstract": "Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.",

Prevailing semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are ill-suited for this task, as they suffer from catastrophic confirmation bias and ignore the intrinsic data manifold. We propose ST-ProC, a novel graph-prototypical multi-objective SSL framework to address these limitations. Our framework synergizes a graph-prototypical core with foundational SSL Support. The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch.",

Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores.",

Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.",

    "abstract": "Finding human-understandable circuits in language models is a central goal of the field of mechanistic interpretability. We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models. Our work produces circuits that achieve an unprecedented level of human understandability and validates them with considerable rigor.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) is fueled by the growing reliance on datasets that blend real and synthetic data. While synthetic data offers scalability and cost-efficiency, it often introduces systematic distributional discrepancies, particularly underrepresenting long-tail knowledge due to truncation effects from data generation mechanisms like top-p sampling, temperature scaling, and finite sampling. These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets. Comprehensive experiments across four tasks, including image classification, sentiment classification, instruction following, and complex reasoning, demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in data valuation with significantly low computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) efficiently finds high-performing parameters by maximizing an acquisition function, which models the promise of parameters. A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches.",

Existing methods are typically optimized to capture features within the in-distribution (ID) data and calculate OOD scores, which often limits pre-trained models from representing distributional boundaries, leading to unreliable OOD detection. Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration. To the best of our knowledge, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that BaCa significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection.",

Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline.",

    "abstract": "Since the 21st century, artificial intelligence has been leading a new round of industrial revolution. Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance.

However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture.

    "abstract": "Right heart failure (RHF) is a disease characterized by abnormalities in the structure or function of the right ventricle (RV), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Industrial process monitoring increasingly relies on sensor-generated time-series data, yet the lack of labels, high variability, and operational noise make it difficult to extract meaningful patterns using conventional methods. Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems.",

    "abstract": "Open-domain question answering over datalakes requires retrieving and composing information from multiple tables, a challenging subtask that demands semantic relevance and structural coherence (e.g., joinability). While exact optimization methods like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) can ensure coherence, their computational complexity is often prohibitive. Conversely, simpler greedy heuristics that optimize for query coverage alone often fail to find these coherent, joinable sets. This paper frames multi-table retrieval as an iterative search process, arguing this approach offers advantages in scalability, interpretability, and flexibility. We propose a general framework and a concrete instantiation: a fast, effective Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval algorithm that holistically balances relevance, coverage, and joinability. Experiments across 5 NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that our iterative method achieves competitive retrieval performance compared to the MIP-based approach while being 4-400x faster depending on the benchmark and search space settings. This work highlights the potential of iterative heuristics for practical, scalable, and composition-aware retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.",

This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems.",

Evaluation across 3,600 diverse samples in five scripting languages demonstrates statistically significant improvements between iterations, showing consistent gains in both summary quality and classification accuracy. Our comprehensive validation approach combines quantitative metrics based on established malware labels with qualitative assessment from both human experts and LLM-based judges, confirming both technical precision and linguistic coherence of generated summaries. To facilitate reproducibility and advance research in this domain, we publish our complete dataset of more than 100K script samples, including annotated seed (0.9K) and test (3.6K) datasets, along with our methodology and evaluation framework.",

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning is one of the state-of-the-art methods for producing near-optimal system controllers. However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller. We evaluate our approach on a gridworld environment and a classic control task. We observe that our proposed distillation to locally- specialized linear models produces policies that are explainable and show that the distillation matches or even slightly outperforms the black-box policy they are distilled from.",

    "abstract": "Accurate protein structures are essential for understanding biological function, yet incorporating experimental data into protein generative models remains a major challenge. Most predictors of experimental observables are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with gradient-based conditional sampling. This is especially limiting in nuclear magnetic resonance, where rich data such as chemical shifts are hard to directly integrate into generative modeling. We introduce a framework for non-differentiable guidance of protein generative models, coupling a continuous diffusion-based generator with any black-box objective via a tailored genetic algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness across three modalities: pairwise distance constraints, nuclear Overhauser effect restraints, and for the first time chemical shifts. These results establish chemical shift guided structure generation as feasible, expose key weaknesses in current predictors, and showcase a general strategy for incorporating diverse experimental signals. Our work points toward automated, data-conditioned protein modeling beyond the limits of differentiability.",

We introduce De-VQA, a dynamic evaluation for visual question answering, uncovering a phenomenon we term transient blindness, overfitting to edit-similar text while ignoring visuals.

    "abstract": "This article presents the first systematic review of unsupervised and semi-supervised computational text-based ideal point estimation (CT-IPE) algorithms, methods designed to infer latent political positions from textual data. These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.",

    "abstract": "Traditional gradient boosting algorithms employ static tree structures with fixed splitting criteria that remain unchanged throughout training, limiting their ability to adapt to evolving gradient distributions and problem-specific characteristics across different learning stages. This work introduces MorphBoost, a new gradient boosting framework featuring self-organizing tree structures that dynamically morph their splitting behavior during training. The algorithm implements adaptive split functions that evolve based on accumulated gradient statistics and iteration-dependent learning pressures, enabling automatic adjustment to problem complexity. Key innovations include: (1) morphing split criterion combining gradient-based scores with information-theoretic metrics weighted by training progress; (2) automatic problem fingerprinting for intelligent parameter configuration across binary/multiclass/regression tasks; (3) vectorized tree prediction achieving significant computational speedups; (4) interaction-aware feature importance detecting multiplicative relationships; and (5) fast-mode optimization balancing speed and accuracy. Comprehensive benchmarking across 10 diverse datasets against competitive models (XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting, HistGradientBoosting, ensemble methods) demonstrates that MorphBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming XGBoost by 0.84% on average. MorphBoost secured the overall winner position with 4/10 dataset wins (40% win rate) and 6/30 top-3 finishes (20%), while maintaining the lowest variance (σ=0.0948) and highest minimum accuracy across all models, revealing superior consistency and robustness. Performance analysis across difficulty levels shows competitive results on easy datasets while achieving notable improvements on advanced problems due to higher adaptation levels.",

    "abstract": "Emerging reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces. However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications.

In this paper, we address the RCPSP variant with uncertain tasks duration (modeled using known probabilities) and aim to minimize the overall expected project duration. Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize.

However, current training frameworks adopt a pre-defined static parallel strategy for these sequences, causing neither communication-parallelization cancellation on short sequences nor out-of-memory on long sequences. To mitigate these issues, we propose ParaDySe, a novel adaptive Parallel strategy switching framework for Dynamic Sequences. ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries. We compare ParaDySe with baselines on representative LLMs under datasets with sequence lengths up to 624K. Experimental results indicate that ParaDySe addresses OOM and CPC bottlenecks in LLM training by systematically integrating long-sequence optimizations with existing frameworks.",

    "abstract": "The genotype-phenotype gap is a persistent barrier to complex trait genetic dissection, worsened by the explosive growth of genomic data (1.5 billion variants identified in the UK Biobank WGS study) alongside persistently scarce and subjective human-defined phenotypes. Digital phenotyping offers a potential solution, yet existing tools fail to balance scalable non-manual phenotype generation and biological interpretability of these quantitative traits. Here we report AIPheno, the first generative AI-driven \"phenotype sequencer\" that bridges this gap. It enables high-throughput, unsupervised extraction of digital phenotypes from imaging data and unlocks their biological meaning via generative network analysis. AIPheno transforms imaging modalities into a rich source of quantitative traits, dramatically enhancing cross-species genetic discovery, including novel loci such as CCBE1 (humans), KITLG-TMTC3 (domestic pigeons), and SOD2-IGF2R (swine). Critically, its generative module decodes AI-derived phenotypes by synthesizing variant-specific images to yield actionable biological insights. For example, it clarifies how the OCA2-HERC2 locus pleiotropically links pigmentation to retinal vascular traits via vascular visibility modulation. Integrating scalable non-manual phenotyping, enhanced genetic discovery power, and generative mechanistic decoding, AIPheno establishes a transformative closed-loop paradigm. This work addresses the longstanding genotype-phenotype imbalance, redefines digital phenotype utility, and accelerates translation of genetic associations into actionable understanding with profound implications for human health and agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) seeks to learn a unified policy for diverse tasks, but often suffers from gradient conflicts across tasks. Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.   To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance.",

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of specific data from trained models to ensure privacy compliance. However, most existing methods assume full access to the original training dataset, which is often impractical. We address a more realistic yet challenging setting: few-shot zero-glance, where only a small subset of the retained data is available and the forget set is entirely inaccessible. We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure. GFN synthesises Optimal Erasure Samples (OES), which induce high loss on target classes, enabling the model to forget class-specific knowledge without access to the original forget data, while preserving performance on retained classes. The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second. Experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that GFOES achieves effective forgetting at both logit and representation levels, while maintaining strong performance using only 5% of the original data. Our framework offers a practical and scalable solution for privacy-preserving machine learning under data-constrained conditions.",

    "abstract": "Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.   We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.",

    "abstract": "Multi-turn interaction remains challenging for online reinforcement learning. A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget.",

This ambiguity hinders the effective evaluation and practical utility of explanation methods.We address this gap by introducing the Reference-Frame $\\times$ Granularity (RFxG) taxonomy, a principled conceptual framework that organizes saliency explanations along two essential axes:Reference-Frame: Distinguishing between pointwise (\"Why this prediction?\") and contrastive (\"Why this and not an alternative?\") explanations.Granularity: Ranging from fine-grained class-level (e.g., \"Why Husky?\") to coarse-grained group-level (e.g., \"Why Dog?\") interpretations.Using the RFxG lens, we demonstrate critical limitations in existing evaluation metrics, which overwhelmingly prioritize pointwise faithfulness while neglecting contrastive reasoning and semantic granularity. To systematically assess explanation quality across both RFxG dimensions, we propose four novel faithfulness metrics. Our comprehensive evaluation framework applies these metrics to ten state-of-the-art saliency methods, four model architectures, and three datasets.By advocating a shift toward user-intent-driven evaluation, our work provides both the conceptual foundation and the practical tools necessary to develop visual explanations that are not only faithful to the underlying model behavior but are also meaningfully aligned with the complexity of human understanding and inquiry.",

By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves 1.9x -- 11.7x speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference. A user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.",

We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision.

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are often adapted through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to specialize their capabilities for downstream tasks. However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects.",

While one-step Gaussian policies enable fast inference, they struggle to capture complex, multimodal action distributions.

To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate MeanFlow to enable direct noise-to-action generation by integrating the velocity field and noise-to-action transformation into a single policy network-eliminating the need for separate velocity estimation. We explore several reformulation variants and identify an effective residual formulation that supports expressive and stable policy learning. Our method offers three key advantages: 1) efficient one-step noise-to-action generation, 2) expressive modelling of multimodal action distributions, and 3) efficient and stable policy learning via Q-learning in a single-stage training setup. Extensive experiments on 73 tasks across the OGBench and D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance in both offline and offline-to-online reinforcement learning settings.

    "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in Small Language Models (SLMs) as resource-efficient alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to unresolved efficiency gaps in model compression. While quantization has proven effective for LLMs, its applicability to SLMs is significantly underexplored, with critical questions about differing quantization bottlenecks and efficiency profiles. This paper introduces SLMQuant, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM compression techniques when applied to SLMs. Through comprehensive multi-track evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks, we analyze how state-of-the-art quantization methods perform on SLMs. Our findings reveal fundamental disparities between SLMs and LLMs in quantization sensitivity, demonstrating that direct transfer of LLM-optimized techniques leads to suboptimal results due to SLMs' unique architectural characteristics and training dynamics. We identify key factors governing effective SLM quantization and propose actionable design principles for SLM-tailored compression. SLMQuant establishes a foundational framework for advancing efficient SLM deployment on low-end devices in edge applications, and provides critical insights for deploying lightweight language models in resource-constrained scenarios.",

    "abstract": "MeanFlow (MF) is a diffusion-motivated generative model that enables efficient few-step generation by learning long jumps directly from noise to data. In practice, it is often used as a latent MF by leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for high-dimensional data modeling. However, MF training remains computationally demanding and is often unstable. During inference, the SD-VAE decoder dominates the generation cost, and MF depends on complex guidance hyperparameters for class-conditional generation. In this work, we develop an efficient training and sampling scheme for MF in the latent space of a Representation Autoencoder (RAE), where a pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., DINO) provides semantically rich latents paired with a lightweight decoder. We observe that naive MF training in the RAE latent space suffers from severe gradient explosion. To stabilize and accelerate training, we adopt Consistency Mid-Training for trajectory-aware initialization and use a two-stage scheme: distillation from a pre-trained flow matching teacher to speed convergence and reduce variance, followed by an optional bootstrapping stage with a one-point velocity estimator to further reduce deviation from the oracle mean flow. This design removes the need for guidance, simplifies training configurations, and reduces computation in both training and sampling. Empirically, our method achieves a 1-step FID of 2.03, outperforming vanilla MF's 3.43, while reducing sampling GFLOPS by 38% and total training cost by 83% on ImageNet 256. We further scale our approach to ImageNet 512, achieving a competitive 1-step FID of 3.23 with the lowest GFLOPS among all baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/sony/mf-rae.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.",

    "abstract": "Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on supervised reward models or external judges that demand abundant annotations. However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series classification is increasingly investigated in space weather research as a means to predict intense solar flare events, which can cause widespread disruptions across modern technological systems. Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems have achieved high-quality performance by bridging the discrepancy between the item space and the language space through item tokenization. However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the interpretability of neural network features from a Bayesian Gaussian view, where optimizing a cost is reaching a probabilistic bound; learning a model approximates a density that makes the bound tight and the cost optimal, often with a Gaussian mixture density. The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.   We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.   Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a project with stochastic activity durations and cash flows under discrete scenarios, where activities must satisfy precedence constraints generating cash inflows and outflows. The objective is to maximize expected net present value (NPV) by accelerating inflows and deferring outflows. We formulate the problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) approach. Comparative experiments demonstrate that DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies, particularly in large-scale or highly uncertain environments, exhibiting superior computational capability, policy reliability, and adaptability. Ablation studies further reveal that the dual-network architecture mitigates overestimation of action values, while the target network substantially improves training convergence and robustness. These results indicate that DDQN not only achieves higher expected NPV in complex project optimization but also provides a reliable framework for stable and effective policy implementation.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks achieve state of the art performance but remain difficult to interpret mechanistically. In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose RoS-Guard, a robust and optimal OCD algorithm tailored for linear systems with uncertainty. Through a tight relaxation and reformulation of the OCD optimization problem, RoS-Guard employs neural unrolling to enable efficient parallel computation via GPU acceleration.

We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively.

However, this computational burden is typically mitigated by existing efficiency methods at the cost of reduced expressivity. We propose \\textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \\emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \\emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling. We prove that Co-Sparsified GNNs are as expressive as the 2-FWL test. Empirically, on PPGN, Co-Sparsify matches or exceeds accuracy on synthetic substructure counting tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks (ZINC, QM9). This study demonstrates that high expressivity and scalability are not mutually exclusive: principled, topology-guided sparsification enables powerful, efficient GNNs with theoretical guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is a longstanding challenge in continual learning, where models lose knowledge from earlier tasks when learning new ones. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), recent architectural advances like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been suggested to offer intrinsic resistance to forgetting by leveraging localized spline-based activations. However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks. Our findings reveal that while KANs exhibit promising retention in low-dimensional algorithmic settings, they remain vulnerable to forgetting in high-dimensional domains such as image classification and language modeling. These results advance the understanding of KANs' strengths and limitations, offering practical insights for continual learning system design.",

By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties.

We provide the first formal foundation for analyzing the long-term effects of such recursive retraining on alignment. Under a two-stage curation mechanism based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, we model alignment as an interaction between two factions: the Model Owner, who filters which outputs should be learned by the model, and the Public User, who determines which outputs are ultimately shared and retained through interactions with the model. Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence.",

In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?   To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.",

    "abstract": "Selecting an appropriate look-back horizon remains a fundamental challenge in time series forecasting (TSF), particularly in the federated learning scenarios where data is decentralized, heterogeneous, and often non-independent. While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning.",

Given $n$ objectives (or tasks), we seek the optimal partition of these objectives into $k \\ll n$ groups, where each group comprises related objectives that can be trained together. This problem arises in applications such as robotics, control, and preference optimization in language models, where learning a single policy for all $n$ objectives is suboptimal as $n$ grows. We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a $2\\%$ error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm. Based on the estimated affinity score matrix, we cluster the $n$ objectives into $k$ groups by maximizing the intra-cluster affinity scores. Experiments on three robotic control and the Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $16\\%$ on average, while delivering up to $26\\times$ faster speedup relative to performing full training to obtain the clusters. Ablation studies validate each component of our approach. For instance, compared with random grouping and gradient-similarity-based grouping, our loss-based clustering yields an improvement of $19\\%$. Finally, we analyze the generalization error of policy networks by measuring the Hessian trace of the loss surface, which gives non-vacuous measures relative to the observed generalization errors.",

    "abstract": "While spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling recurring traffic patterns, their reliability plummets during non-recurring events like accidents. This failure occurs because GNNs are fundamentally correlational models, learning historical patterns that are invalidated by the new causal factors introduced during disruptions. To address this, we propose Event-CausNet, a framework that uses a Large Language Model to quantify unstructured event reports, builds a causal knowledge base by estimating average treatment effects, and injects this knowledge into a dual-stream GNN-LSTM network using a novel causal attention mechanism to adjust and enhance the forecast. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework bridges the gap between correlational models and causal reasoning, providing a solution that is more accurate and transferable, while also offering crucial interpretability, providing a more reliable foundation for real-world traffic management during critical disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation is the cornerstone of effective collaboration among heterogeneous team members. In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks.",

However, current AI model evaluation practices for developing IDS/IPS focus predominantly on accuracy metrics, often overlooking whether datasets represent industry-specific threats. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments. The efficiency and practicality of the framework are validated through deployment in a real-world case study, underscoring its capacity to inform dataset selection and enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS in operational environments.",

    "abstract": "Bipartite learning is a machine learning task that aims to predict interactions between pairs of instances. It has been applied to various domains, including drug-target interactions, RNA-disease associations, and regulatory network inference. Despite being widely investigated, current methods still present drawbacks, as they are often designed for a specific application and thus do not generalize to other problems or present scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose Oxytrees: proxy-based biclustering model trees. Oxytrees compress the interaction matrix into row- and column-wise proxy matrices, significantly reducing training time without compromising predictive performance. We also propose a new leaf-assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the time taken for prediction. Finally, Oxytrees employ linear models using the Kronecker product kernel in their leaves, resulting in shallower trees and thus even faster training. Using 15 datasets, we compared the predictive performance of ensembles of Oxytrees with that of the current state-of-the-art. We achieved up to 30-fold improvement in training times compared to state-of-the-art biclustering forests, while demonstrating competitive or superior performance in most evaluation settings, particularly in the inductive setting. Finally, we provide an intuitive Python API to access all datasets, methods and evaluation measures used in this work, thus enabling reproducible research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Mesh-based simulation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been recognized as a promising approach for modeling fluid dynamics. However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.",

Our approach builds upon UED to automatically produce solvable yet challenging task-level pairs for policy training. To evaluate ATLAS and drive progress in the field, we introduce an evaluation suite that models tasks as reward machines in Minigrid levels.

Personalized Fine-Tuning (PFT), a popular post-hoc solution, fine-tunes the final global model locally but often overfits to skewed client distributions or fails under domain shifts. We propose adapting Linear Probing followed by full Fine-Tuning (LP-FT), a principled centralized strategy for alleviating feature distortion (Kumar et al., 2022), to the FL setting. Through systematic evaluation across seven datasets and six PFT variants, we demonstrate LP-FT's superiority in balancing personalization and generalization. Our analysis uncovers federated feature distortion, a phenomenon where local fine-tuning destabilizes globally learned features, and theoretically characterizes how LP-FT mitigates this via phased parameter updates. We further establish conditions (e.g., partial feature overlap, covariate-concept shift) under which LP-FT outperforms standard fine-tuning, offering actionable guidelines for deploying robust personalization in FL.",

    "abstract": "Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components are trained jointly, is an attractive alternative to cascaded systems because it offers a simpler pipeline and lower inference latency. However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English",

    "abstract": "Assurance for artificial intelligence (AI) systems remains fragmented across software supply-chain security, adversarial machine learning, and governance documentation. Existing transparency mechanisms - including Model Cards, Datasheets, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) - advance provenance reporting but rarely provide verifiable, machine-readable evidence of model security. This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields. The AIRS Framework thus extends SBOM practice to the AI domain by coupling threat modeling with automated, auditable evidence generation, providing a principled foundation for standardized, trustworthy, and machine-verifiable AI risk documentation.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model while preserving the privacy of their local data. Within this paradigm, the intellectual property rights (IPR) of client models are critical assets that must be protected. In practice, the central server responsible for maintaining the global model may maliciously manipulate the global model to erase client contributions or falsely claim sole ownership, thereby infringing on clients' IPR. Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for asserting model ownership and protecting intellectual property. However, existing FL watermarking approaches remain limited, suffering from potential watermark collisions among clients, insufficient watermark security, and non-intuitive verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FLClear, a novel framework that simultaneously achieves collision-free watermark aggregation, enhanced watermark security, and visually interpretable ownership verification. Specifically, FLClear introduces a transposed model jointly optimized with contrastive learning to integrate the watermarking and main task objectives. During verification, the watermark is reconstructed from the transposed model and evaluated through both visual inspection and structural similarity metrics, enabling intuitive and quantitative ownership verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted over various datasets, aggregation schemes, and attack scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FLClear and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL watermarking methods.",

    "abstract": "The security of autonomous vehicle networks is facing major challenges, owing to the complexity of sensor integration, real-time performance demands, and distributed communication protocols that expose vast attack surfaces around both individual and network-wide safety. Existing security schemes are unable to provide sub-10 ms (milliseconds) anomaly detection and distributed coordination of large-scale networks of vehicles within an acceptable safety/privacy framework. This paper introduces a three-tier hybrid security architecture HAVEN (Hierarchical Autonomous Vehicle Enhanced Network), which decouples real-time local threat detection and distributed coordination operations. It incorporates a light ensemble anomaly detection model on the edge (first layer), Byzantine-fault-tolerant federated learning to aggregate threat intelligence at a regional scale (middle layer), and selected blockchain mechanisms (top layer) to ensure critical security coordination. Extensive experimentation is done on a real-world autonomous driving dataset. Large-scale simulations with the number of vehicles ranging between 100 and 1000 and different attack types, such as sensor spoofing, jamming, and adversarial model poisoning, are conducted to test the scalability and resiliency of HAVEN. Experimental findings show sub-10 ms detection latency with an accuracy of 94% and F1-score of 92% across multimodal sensor data, Byzantine fault tolerance validated with 20\\% compromised nodes, and a reduced blockchain storage overhead, guaranteeing sufficient differential privacy. The proposed framework overcomes the important trade-off between real-time safety obligation and distributed security coordination with novel three-tiered processing. The scalable architecture of HAVEN is shown to provide great improvement in detection accuracy as well as network resilience over other methods.",

    "abstract": "Context: Large language models (LLMs) are released faster than users' ability to evaluate them rigorously. When LLMs underpin research, such as identifying relevant literature for systematic reviews (SRs), robust empirical assessment is essential. Objective: We identify and discuss key challenges in assessing LLM performance for selecting relevant literature, identify good (evaluation) practices, and propose recommendations. Method: Using a recent large-scale study as an example, we identify problems with the use of traditional metrics for assessing the performance of Gen-AI tools for identifying relevant literature in SRs. We analyzed 27 additional papers investigating this issue, extracted the performance metrics, and found both good practices and widespread problems, especially with the use and reporting of performance metrics for SR screening. Results: Major weaknesses included: i) a failure to use metrics that are robust to imbalanced data and do not directly indicate whether results are better than chance, e.g., the use of Accuracy, ii) a failure to consider the impact of lost evidence when making claims concerning workload savings, and iii) pervasive failure to report the full confusion matrix (or performance metrics from which it can be reconstructed) which is essential for future meta-analyses. On the positive side, we extract good (evaluation) practices on which our recommendations for researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers, are built. Conclusions: SR screening evaluations should prioritize lost evidence/recall alongside chance-anchored and cost-sensitive Weighted MCC (WMCC) metric, report complete confusion matrices, treat unclassifiable outputs as referred-back positives for assessment, adopt leakage-aware designs with non-LLM baselines and open artifacts, and ground conclusions in cost-benefit analysis where FNs carry higher penalties than FPs.",

Our pipeline begins with an onboarding stage that generates object representations from either traditional 3D CAD models or, in their absence, by rapidly reconstructing a high-fidelity neural representation (NeRF) from multi-view images. Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS). A decoder then establishes robust 2D-3D correspondences to determine the final pose. Evaluated on the challenging BOP benchmarks, our integrated system demonstrates a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency, showcasing its practical applicability in both model-based and model-free scenarios.",

We introduce PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics (PIDLD), a novel sampling acceleration algorithm that reinterprets the sampling process using control-theoretic principles. By treating energy gradients as feedback signals, PIDLD combines historical gradients (the integral term) and gradient trends (the derivative term) to efficiently traverse energy landscapes and adaptively stabilize, thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to produce high-quality samples. Our approach requires no additional training, datasets, or prior information, making it immediately integrable with any Langevin-based method. Extensive experiments across image generation and reasoning tasks demonstrate that PIDLD achieves higher quality with fewer steps, making Langevin-based generative models more practical for efficiency-critical applications.

Previous work by Ainsworth et al.

In this work, we extend their approach by also incorporating scaling symmetries, presenting an autoencoder framework utilizing ScaleGMNs as invariant encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method aligns Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) under both permutation and scaling symmetries without explicitly solving the assignment problem. This approach ensures that similar networks naturally converge within the same basin, facilitating model merging, i.e., smooth linear interpolation while avoiding regions of high loss.

    "abstract": "Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.",

However, acquiring LDL dataset is costly and time-consuming, which leads to the birth of incomplete label distribution learning (IncomLDL). All the previous IncomLDL methods set the description degrees of \"missing\" labels in an instance to 0, but remains those of other labels unchanged. This setting is unrealistic because when certain labels are missing, the degrees of the remaining labels will increase accordingly. We fix this unrealistic setting in IncomLDL and raise a new problem: LDL with hidden labels (HidLDL), which aims to recover a complete label distribution from a real-world incomplete label distribution where certain labels in an instance are omitted during annotation. To solve this challenging problem, we discover the significance of proportional information of the observed labels and capture it by an innovative constraint to utilize it during the optimization process. We simultaneously use local feature similarity and the global low-rank structure to reveal the mysterious veil of hidden labels. Moreover, we theoretically give the recovery bound of our method, proving the feasibility of our method in learning from hidden labels. Extensive recovery and predictive experiments on various datasets prove the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art LDL and IncomLDL methods.",

Traditional strategies that align source and target feature distributions are infeasible in FTTA due to the absence of training data and unpredictable target domains. In this work, we exploit a dual perspective on FTTA, and propose Agnostic FTTA (AFTTA) as a novel formulation that enables the usage of off-the-shelf domain transformations during test-time to enable direct generalization to unforeseeable target data. To address this, we develop an uncover-and-unlearn approach. First, we uncover potential unwanted shifts between source and target domains by simulating them through predefined mappings and consider them as nuisances. Then, during test-time prediction, the model is enforced to unlearn these nuisances by regularizing the consequent shifts in latent representations and label predictions. Specifically, a mutual information-based criterion is devised and applied to guide nuisances unlearning in the feature space and encourage confident and consistent prediction in label space. Our proposed approach explicitly addresses agnostic domain shifts, enabling superior model generalization under FTTA constraints. Extensive experiments on various tasks, involving corruption and style shifts, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view multi-label data offers richer perspectives for artificial intelligence, but simultaneously presents significant challenges for feature selection due to the inherent complexity of interrelations among features, views and labels. Attention mechanisms provide an effective way for analyzing these intricate relationships. They can compute importance weights for information by aggregating correlations between Query and Key matrices to focus on pertinent values. However, existing attention-based feature selection methods predominantly focus on intra-view relationships, neglecting the complementarity of inter-view features and the critical feature-label correlations. Moreover, they often fail to account for feature redundancy, potentially leading to suboptimal feature subsets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method based on Redundancy-optimized Multi-head Attention Networks for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection (RMAN-MMFS). Specifically, we employ each individual attention head to model intra-view feature relationships and use the cross-attention mechanisms between different heads to capture inter-view feature complementarity. Furthermore, we design static and dynamic feature redundancy terms: the static term mitigates redundancy within each view, while the dynamic term explicitly models redundancy between unselected and selected features across the entire selection process, thereby promoting feature compactness. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets, compared against six multi-view multi-label feature selection methods, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.",
