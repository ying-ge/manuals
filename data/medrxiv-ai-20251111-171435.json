    "abstract": "Public health increasingly relies on digital infrastructures, yet data remains fragmented across clinical, behavioral, and social domains. Customer Data Platforms (CDPs), originally created in marketing to unify diverse information into dynamic individual profiles, could provide a new approach for person-centered public health. This article explores the strategic potential of applying CDP principles, such as data unification, identity resolution, segmentation, and timely intervention, to enhance surveillance, prevention, and chronic disease management. A conceptual framework is presented and demonstrated through a breast cancer screening scenario, illustrating how CDPs could enable personalized outreach and integration with artificial intelligence (AI). Although promising, there are significant challenges related to privacy, interoperability, fairness, and governance. Responsible deployment requires socio-technical strategies that emphasize transparency, ethical oversight, and person involvement.",

    "abstract": "Physicians face a significant documentation burden, spending twice as much time on electronic health records (EHRs) as on direct patient care. Consultation summary reports from the emergency department (ED) are critical for continuity of care and clinical decision-making. This study aims to evaluate the quality and utility of automatically generated neurological consultation reports with clear recommendations, while reducing neurologists' documentation burden. We used neurological consultation reports (n = 250) from the ED as reference outputs. For each case, we fed the report's constituent components into the large language model (LLM). Using prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate auto-summarized reports, which were then compared against the original consultation reports. The Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and semantic embedding (Clinical-BioBert) were used as performance metrics. The LLM-generated report exhibited high semantic similarity with the neurologist's report (0.89 ± 0.03). However, significant differences in report length were observed, with LLM-generated reports being more concise than those written by attending neurologists (61.56 vs. 94.75 words, p < 0.001). Additionally, LLM-generated reports were written in a more straightforward and accessible style (FKGL = 11.3 vs. 12.22, p < 0.001). Despite these strengths, the LLM-generated reports exhibited substantial divergence in writing style from neurologists' reports (ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.25, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.09, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.19). LLM-generated neurological consultation reports demonstrate strong semantic alignment with human-authored reports while offering a more concise and accessible format. Notable differences in writing style suggest a standardized approach that, while effective in conveying clinical content, may lack the personalization of neurologist-written reports.",

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in the progression and therapeutic resistance of HCC. Interventional therapies have emerged as pivotal modalities in the treatment of liver cancer, especially in cases that are unsuitable for surgical resection. The evolution of these techniques has been markedly enhanced by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which has the potential to increase precision, improve outcomes, and personalize patient care. This review covers modern interventional therapies for liver cancer, highlighting recent advances in minimally invasive procedures. It describes the intricate liver TME and emphasizes the importance of characterizing its diversity and identifying therapeutic targets. Additionally, we discuss how AI can decipher TME complexities, predict responses, categorize patients, and personalize treatments. By elucidating connections between the TME, therapeutic interventions, and AI, this review aims to improve the management and care of patients with liver cancer.",

    "abstract": "Remote robotic surgery (RRS) represents a frontier in surgical innovation, integrating robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-speed communication networks. Despite its clinical significance, the global research landscape and conceptual evolution of RRS remain insufficiently mapped. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 857 Scopus-indexed documents (1980-2025) was conducted using Bibliometrix (R-package), VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. Analyses covered descriptive trends, country productivity, citation impact, collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence, Bradford's Law of journal concentration, CiteSpace co-citation clustering, and thematic evolution. Thematic mapping was performed using the Walktrap clustering algorithm (250 words, minimum cluster frequency = 5) to visualize conceptual structures and developmental trajectories. RRS research exhibited an annual growth rate of 10.35%, with strong international collaboration (26.96%). The United States, China, Japan, and France dominated global contributions. Keyword co-occurrence and CiteSpace clustering revealed five thematic domains-robotic systems, telemedicine integration, surgical innovation, AI-assisted imaging, and 5G-enabled connectivity. Bradford's Law identified a small core of specialized journals as primary publication outlets. Thematic evolution (1980-2025) indicated three conceptual eras: foundational simulation and telepresence (1980-2013), technological integration with 5G and AI (2014-2022), and intelligent convergence emphasizing deep learning, blockchain, and ultra-low-latency communication (2023-2025). Thematic mapping further highlighted telesurgery as a basic theme and surgery as a motor theme driving interdisciplinary expansion. This bibliometric synthesis reveals a paradigm shift from early teleoperation frameworks to AI-driven, 5G-powered, and cybersecure surgical ecosystems. Future research should prioritize real-time data fusion, robotic autonomy, and ethical frameworks guiding intelligent telesurgical networks.",

    "abstract": "Risk stratification remains a critical challenge in non-small cell lung cancer patients for optimal therapy selection. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-powered spatial cellomics approach that combines histology, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging and multimodal machine learning to characterize the complex cellular relationships of 43 cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment in a real-world retrospective cohort of 1168 non-small cell lung cancer patients from two large German cancer centers. The model identifies cell niches associated with survival and achieves a 14% and 47% improvement in risk stratification in the two main non-small cell lung cancer subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, combining niche patterns with conventional cancer staging. Our results show that complex immune cell niche patterns identify potentially undertreated high-risk patients qualifying for adjuvant therapy. Our approach highlights the potential of artificial intelligence powered multiplex imaging analyses to better understand the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to cancer progression and to improve risk stratification and treatment selection in non-small cell lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "The PIRP Project (Progressive Renal Insufficiency Prevention), launched in Emilia-Romagna in the early 2000s, was created to establish a network between general practitioners and nephrologists aimed at the early identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD), slowing its progression, and improving clinical outcomes. The project included several phases: a training phase for general practitioners, the establishment of dedicated outpatient clinics, and the creation of a regional electronic registry, which today includes more than 38,000 patients. The results have shown a reduction in CKD progression, fewer urgent dialysis starts, and better control of comorbidities. PIRP differs from the national PDTA for CKD in its operational and regional approach, based on real-world data and multidisciplinary co-management, whereas the PDTA represents a general regulatory framework. The project has developed predictive models (such as CT-PIRP), inspired comparative European studies, and today stands as a model of integrated healthcare, useful for the implementation of nephroprotective drugs and artificial intelligence. Twenty years after its inception, PIRP remains an example of proactive and collaborative medicine, anticipating modern paradigms of population health management.",

    "abstract": "The promising integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) or AI chatbots, into medical education and practice necessitates rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. While chatbot performance has been assessed against standardized exams like the bar, medical and dental boards, and in diagnostic specialties such as radiology and ophthalmology, a critical gap exists within the complex discipline of pathology, specifically concerning subspecialty areas like head and neck pathology. Conducting a pilot study evaluating chatbot responses to head and neck pathology board-style questions is therefore essential and novel. Crucially for education, this pilot study evaluated six AI chatbots on their performance in answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) retrieved from authorities in the field of head and neck pathology. Twenty MCQs relevant to head and neck pathology were identified from the public domain. A total of 120 responses from six chatbots were evaluated for response and citation accuracy. Although AI chatbots answered head and neck pathology board-style questions with 85-100% accuracy, citation accuracy and performance on image-based questions were poor. Considering the pedagogical principle that actively challenging exam questions enhances memory retention and learning outcomes compared to passive text review, AI-generated multiple-choice questions specifically designed for head and neck pathology study revision purposes were generated. The generated MCQs were determined to be at a more fundamental level and suitable for predoctoral dental students or first-year pathology residents. This pilot study probed the limitations of these tools in accurately addressing diagnostic and interpretive challenges. Furthermore, the recommendations and guidelines informed from the results of this pilot study represent a vital first step in the addressing the responsible use of AI for head and neck pathology education and practice.",

In terms of publication volume, China, the United States, and the England ranked at the forefront, while Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences emerged as central contributors in this field. Keyword co-occurrence and burst analysis indicated a transition in research emphasis-from an initial stage centered on \"force feedback\" and \"master-slave control\" to a more sophisticated paradigm integrating \"artificial intelligence\", \"cloud computing\" and \"5G communication\". Simultaneously, technical challenges have evolved beyond latency optimization to include pressing issues such as cybersecurity, ethical governance, medical insurance reimbursement, and multimodal sensory integration. This study presents, for the first time, a three-stage model characterizing the knowledge evolution of RAOTS and proposes a structured framework mapping its technological development path, thereby providing empirical evidence to support future standardization, clinical translation, and interdisciplinary cooperation.",

Recent advances in artificial-intelligence algorithms reliably integrate multimodal clinical, imaging and pathological data, producing highly reproducible tumour-staging and risk-stratification models that inform personalised operative strategies. Concurrently, navigation platforms that fuse computed-tomography, magnetic-resonance, ultrasound and fluorescence datasets generate patient-specific three-dimensional reconstructions with sub-millimeter registration accuracy, enabling dynamic margin delineation and reducing inadvertent tissue injury. Predictive analytics that assimilate intra-operative metrics with early postoperative information can forecast survival and complication profiles, thereby supporting tailored follow-up protocols. Remaining barriers include safeguarding data privacy, accelerating image-registration and inference speeds, meeting high computational-resource demands and offsetting the substantial capital and maintenance costs of these systems. Nevertheless, the convergent evolution of artificial intelligence and real-time imaging navigation is poised to transform radical gastrectomy by elevating surgical precision, enhancing patient safety and improving long-term outcomes; realizing this promise will require algorithmic refinement, multicenter validation, robust ethical frameworks and cost-effective implementation models.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatitis poses persistent diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation, variable disease course, and lack of targeted interventions. Conventional tools, such as serum enzymes, cross-sectional imaging and clinical scoring systems, often exhibit limited sensitivity and prognostic value, especially during early or atypical stages. Moreover, therapeutic development remains slow, with limited progress toward personalized or mechanism-based strategies. These limitations highlight a critical need for integrative data-driven approaches. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance clinical decision-making in pancreatitis. This narrative review synthesizes recent progress in AI applications across three domains. First, AI-enabled diagnostic platforms incorporating radiomics, deep learning-based imaging analysis, and biomarker optimization have improved early detection and differentiation of pancreatic diseases. Second, AI-driven prognostic models now allow real-time severity prediction, complication forecasting, and recurrence risk assessment, some of which have been deployed in hospital information systems for intensive care units and mortality risk triage. Third, AI-assisted drug discovery and network pharmacology, particularly in combination with traditional Chinese medicine, have revealed novel therapeutic opportunities. Despite encouraging developments, challenges remain in data standardization, model transparency and clinical validation. A multidisciplinary strategy integrating omics data, longitudinal monitoring and pharmacological modeling may help bridge current gaps and advance precision medicine in pancreatitis care.",

Deep learning is an advanced and complex form of ML, structured with different levels of specific algorithms known as convolutional neural networks that can rapidly and accurately process unstructured, high-dimensional data, such as texts, images, and waveforms. Natural language processing is dedicated to facilitating interactions between computers and humans using natural language and helps to analyze, understand, and derive actionable information from unstructured healthcare data, including electronic health records, clinical notes, medical literature, and patient-generated content. Computer vision focuses on enabling computers to see and interpret images and videos and serves as an augmentation tool for endoscopists, improving accuracy and decreasing procedural time.

    "abstract": "Hepatology encompasses various aspects, such as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, liver failure, liver tumors, and liver transplantation. The global epidemiological situation of liver diseases is grave, posing a substantial threat to human health and quality of life. Characterized by high incidence and mortality rates, liver diseases have emerged as a prominent global public health concern. In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and radiomics has transformed medical research and clinical practice, demonstrating considerable potential in hepatology. AI is capable of automatically detecting abnormal cells in liver tissue sections, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of pathological diagnosis. Deep learning models are able to extract features from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging images to facilitate liver disease classification. Machine learning models are capable of integrating clinical data to forecast disease progression and treatment responses, thus supporting clinical decision-making for personalized medicine. Through the analysis of imaging data, laboratory results, and genomic information, AI can assist in diagnosis, forecast disease progression, and optimize treatment plans, thereby improving clinical outcomes for liver disease patients. This minireview intends to comprehensively summarize the state-of-the-art theories and applications of AI in hepatology, explore the opportunities and challenges it presents in clinical practice, basic research, and translational medicine, and propose future research directions to guide the advancement of hepatology and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Traditional knowledge on health has long contributed to global health-care systems. Rooted in the cultural and ecological heritage of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, traditional knowledge has influenced pharmaceutical research, biodiversity conservation and public health strategies. However, concerns over misappropriation of traditional knowledge and inadequate benefit-sharing with the sources of such knowledge persist. The World Intellectual Property Organization Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge mandates patent disclosure requirements for genetic resources and traditional knowledge. While a step forward, the treaty's success depends on its effective implementation, ethical documentation of traditional knowledge, governance of artificial intelligence and equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms, among other factors. We examine traditional knowledge protection under intellectual property systems, the provisions of the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty, challenges to documentation of traditional knowledge and the role of artificial intelligence in the governance of traditional knowledge. By fostering a legally robust and technology-driven protection system for traditional knowledge, policy-makers can ensure that traditional knowledge remains both a protected cultural heritage and a resource for sustainable innovation in global health.",

    "abstract": "The aspirations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) precision medicine and precision brain health are not fully realized despite significant advances in early pathological detection. Hampering progress is the difficult challenge of the accurate detection of behavioral symptoms that can help differentiate those at high risk specific to AD versus those with more AD and related dementias (ADRD), who may have AD along with other types of dementia, as well as those who will and will not progress to clinically expressed disease. Technological advances in hardware, software, and analytics are paving the way to opportunities to overcome these long-standing barriers to early clinical symptom detection, when recent and emerging interventions might be most effective. It is important to note that these innovations must not exist in isolation. Integration of data from both AD/ADRD related studies and non-AD related studies is needed whenever brain-related measures are collected to fully realize the scientific opportunities. We envision a near future of harmonized participant data sharing, encompassing standardized multimodal data alongside emerging digital streams, to deliver an invaluable resource for the global research community. HIGHLIGHTS: Technology is overcoming barriers to accurate early detection of behavioral symptoms of AD/ADRD. The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center is paving the way for the integration of technological advances into AD/ADRD research. A technologically-enabled framework provides a solution for open science on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Bone fracture continues to pose a significant clinical challenge in regenerative medicine due to limited repair capacity and inadequate therapeutic options. Among the various therapeutic strategies, mesenchymal stem cells have shown strong potential due to their ability to promote bone formation, modulate inflammation, and migrate to injury sites. However, clinical outcomes have been limited by issues like low survival rates, poor integration, and non-specific distribution after transplantation. Functionalized mesenchymal cells enhanced through genetic, chemical, or material-based modifications have emerged as an advanced strategy to overcome these limitations and significantly improve bone regeneration. This review explores recent developments in the functionalization of stem cells to increase their bone-forming potential. It covers techniques of gene modification, preconditioning, nanoparticle integration, and scaffold-based delivery. The role of these engineered cells is in activating key pathways involved in bone repair, including bone morphogenetic proteins and Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the study highlights current delivery platforms, including injectable gels, printed scaffolds, and bioactive coatings that support targeted, sustained cell activity. Despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, unresolved challenges in manufacturing, immune compatibility, and regulatory pathways persist, prompting the exploration of emerging solutions like precision-engineered implants and artificial intelligence-driven design to guide the future of advanced bone regeneration therapies.",

    "abstract": "Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs broadly distributed in eukaryotes, are emerging as pivotal regulators in the field of epigenomics. In addition to guiding 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation modifications at specific rRNA sites to maintain ribosomal stability and support protein synthesis, snoRNAs have been increasingly implicated in epigenetic regulation, influencing gene expression, chromatin architecture, and RNA modification patterns. Accurate identification of potential snoRNA-disease associations (SDAs) is therefore essential for understanding epigenomic dysregulation in complex diseases and facilitating early intervention and drug repurposing. Although artificial intelligence (AI) methods have advanced SDA prediction, they are still hindered by issues such as sample imbalance and high false-negative rates. To address these challenges, we propose ESAE-SDA, a novel model integrating sparse autoencoders with an ensemble learning framework. ESAE-SDA first constructs a comprehensive snoRNA-disease representation using multi-source similarity metrics. It then applies k-means clustering to select high-confidence negative samples and employs a deep sparse autoencoder with sparsity constraints to learn compact, discriminative embeddings. Finally, multiple GNN-based learners are independently trained on dynamically resampled data, and ensemble inference is performed via weighted fusion, substantially enhancing robustness and generalization. Experiments on a public SDA dataset demonstrate that ESAE-SDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, a case study on ophthalmic diseases highlights the model's ability to uncover epigenetically relevant snoRNAs with potential regulatory and therapeutic significance, underscoring its value in epigenomics-driven disease research and target discovery.",

    "abstract": "Osborne fractionation remains a cornerstone in food science for categorizing seed storage proteins (SSPs), yet molecular distinctions among the classes remain unclear. This study employs a computational framework integrating structural modeling, AI (artificial intelligence)-driven classification, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate these underlying physicochemical differences. Using a dataset of 1039 SSPs from 215 species, sequence and structural-based features were extracted and compared to identify class-specific characteristics, such as low hydrophobic patch area of albumins. Machine learning (ML) classifiers, including binary support vector machines and graph convolutional networks were trained on these features, achieving validation and test accuracies ranging from 96.0 % to 100.0 %. Model interpretations using SHapley Additive exPlanations and saliency mapping revealed key distinguishing features between albumin/prolamin and globulin/glutelin, respectively. For the albumin and prolamin classes, physicochemical feature comparisons and ML classifiers identified factors underlying their solubility differences, such as the low abundance of charged residues in prolamins. On the other hand, although certain features, such as mean surface electric potential, distinguished globulins from glutelins, no clear association was found between these features and experimental solubility trend. Notably, saliency analysis of globulins and glutelins highlighted loop and helical regions outside the conserved β-barrel motifs, where compositional differences in glutamic acid, glycine, serine, and glutamine residues were observed. MD simulations explored solvent-specific conformational changes in representative SSPs, with all-atomic simulations performed on single monomers and coarse-grained simulations conducted with multiple monomers. For 2S soy albumin and 19 kDa maize prolamin, distinct hydrogen bonding patterns was observed during their adaptations to 70 % ethanol environment, and the expected aggregation tendency was reproduced in the multiple-monomer simulation. Taken together with the highlighted features in ML classification, these results suggest that the experimental solubility of albumins and prolamins can be explained at the monomeric level. However, for pea legumin A (globulin) and rice glutelin A1, no clear differences in structural and aggregation dynamics were observed, and monomeric properties alone failed to account for their distinct solubility. These findings suggest that glutelin insolubility is likely dictated by inter-protein disulfide networks rather than intrinsic monomeric characteristics, aligning with previous experimental observations.",

    "abstract": "The lack of experimental structures for the majority of protein-protein complexes has motivated the development of a variety of strategies for the structural modeling of protein complexes, such as computational docking, in active development for the last decades, and the more recent artificial intelligence (AI)-based ground-breaking methodologies. Among the existing computational docking methods, Python docking (pyDock) has shown competitive predictive rates and high robustness over the years. However, the field has dramatically changed with the appearance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, like AlphaFold. While structure prediction of individual proteins is virtually solved by this program, the focus is now on how to improve the prediction of challenging cases like antibody-antigen complexes, multiprotein complexes, weak interactions, or highly flexible interacting proteins. Successful strategies are based on the generation of more diverse sets of models and the integration with other \"classical\" approaches that facilitate the identification of the correct models. Here, we will show in practical terms how to combine the structural modeling capabilities of AlphaFold with the energy-based scoring function in pyDock to improve structural predictions in challenging protein-protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and translational research play a decisive role in advancing evidence-based endodontics by bridging basic science with clinical applications. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and advances in clinical and translational research in Endodontics, addressing methodological foundations, diagnostic challenges, and emerging technologies. It highlights the importance of well-designed randomized controlled trials, robust outcome definitions, and the inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures. The integration of advanced imaging, particularly cone-beam computed tomography, has significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment monitoring. Molecular biology techniques, including polymerase chain reaction and biomarker profiling, have expanded the understanding of endodontic microbiome, immune responses, and host factors related to treatment outcomes. Despite these advances, persistent limitations include diagnostic imprecision, lack of standardized criteria, and underutilization of biomarkers and omics data in clinical practice. The rise of precision dentistry, propelled by genomics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, holds the potential to revolutionize endodontic care through personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Bridging existing gaps will require rigorous study designs, coordinated multicenter efforts, and the effective integration of molecular diagnostics, all of which are critical to advancing endodontic science and optimizing patient outcomes. Likewise, the full potential of translational science can be harnessed to reshape the future of endodontics.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of generative large language models (LLMs) necessitates a fundamental reevaluation of traditional didactic lectures in medical education, particularly within psychiatry. The specialty's inherent diagnostic ambiguity, biopsychosocial complexity, and reliance on nuanced interpersonal skills demand an educational model that transcends mere information transfer, focusing instead on cultivating sophisticated clinical reasoning. This viewpoint argues for a shift from passive knowledge transmission to active, facilitated development of higher-order thinking, aligning with the Bloom taxonomy. We describe four core propositions: (1) shifting foundational knowledge acquisition to faculty-curated asynchronous artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted micromodules; (2) transforming synchronous time into \"Ambiguity Seminars\" for discussing nuanced cases, biopsychosocial formulation, and ethical dilemmas, leveraging faculty expertise in guiding reasoning; (3) integrating live LLM critical interaction drills to develop prompt engineering skills and critical appraisal of AI outputs; and (4) realigning assessment methods (eg, objective structured clinical examinations [OSCEs], reflective writing) to evaluate clinical reasoning and integrative skills rather than rote recall. Successful implementation requires comprehensive faculty development, explicit institutional investment, and a phased approach that addresses scalability across varying resource settings. This reimagined approach aims to cultivate clinical wisdom, equipping psychiatric trainees with adaptive reasoning frameworks essential for excellence in an AI-mediated future.",

However, the current precision surgery paradigm does not account for the significant influence of social determinants of health (SDOH) on biological and surgical outcomes. In this review, we propose recommendations to integrate SDOH into precision surgery to optimize thoracic cancer care for better outcomes. We introduce \"socio-precision surgery (SPS)\" as an approach that embeds health equity principles into personalized surgical care.

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaques are complex and heterogeneous structures, originating as fatty streaks in the vasculature and formed by the accumulation of lipids and foam cells. Over time, these lesions progress as inflammation, smooth muscle cell proliferation and phenotypic switching, and extracellular matrix deposition contribute to plaque growth, culminating in their fracture, reactive thrombogenesis, and a cardiovascular event such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Traditional bulk mass spectrometry (MS) analysis has yielded critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of plaque formation and disease progression, but it is unable to determine the spatial heterogeneity and microenvironmental complexity within the lesion. Recent advances in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) based omics, including spatial lipidomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have enabled unprecedented visualization of molecular distribution in atherosclerotic plaques at cellular resolution. These techniques promise to elucidate the distinct cellular crosstalk, lesion vulnerability, and sex-specific disease mechanisms that contribute to plaque development and rupture. This review examines the recent advances in MS-based spatial omics and their application to atherosclerotic plaques in both experimental models and human samples. We highlight recent findings, explore their implications for precision medicine and translational research, and discuss current challenges in sample preparation and data integration. Despite challenges, we suggest approaches for integration of MS-based spatial omics using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance data integration, interpretation, and translational applications in atherosclerosis research. These advances promise to broaden our understanding of atherosclerosis and identify novel therapeutic targets to limit the burden of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) criteria provide an important framework for evaluating treatment efficacy and tumour progression in clinical studies of paediatric brain tumours. As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly transforms clinical practice, integrating AI into the RAPNO framework presents a unique opportunity to enhance quantitative, data-driven approaches for response assessment. However, successful clinical implementation faces challenges, including variability in imaging protocols, scarce annotated datasets, and regulatory and ethical considerations. To address these barriers, this Policy Review, led by the AI for Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (AI-RAPNO) subcommittee, outlines key challenges and proposes recommendations to improve AI trustworthiness, generalisability, and implementation in paediatric neuro-oncology. We highlight the potential of AI for response assessment, multimodal integration, and synthetic control groups in clinical trials. Our recommendations emphasise the need for standardised imaging protocols, robust validation frameworks, and infrastructure to support AI readiness in clinical studies. By addressing these needs, AI-RAPNO aims to bridge the gap between AI research and clinical application, ensuring reliable and actionable AI-driven tools for paediatric neuro-oncology.",

    "abstract": "Managing valvular heart disease (VHD) requires integrating multimodal data, including demographics, symptoms, biomarkers, electrocardiogram findings, and imaging studies. However, the capacity and processing power of the human mind are limited, particularly in the current era where vast quantities of complex data require rapid processing. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the management of VHD offers an opportunity to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline clinical workflows, optimize procedural strategies, and predict outcomes and disease progression. Subsets of AI such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms can uncover the unseen data from routine investigations (eg, electrocardiograms, echocardiography, and computed tomography), providing robust and accurate risk prediction tools to inform personalized treatment strategies. Intraprocedurally, AI-based enhancements in imaging guidance can be leveraged to improve procedural safety and success. Digital twin technology can allow case-specific disease modelling, such as simulating valve designs and predicting adverse events, fostering precision medicine. By using the full potential of AI, clinicians can provide a comprehensive, personalized management strategy for VHD patients, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes. However, models based on AI algorithms require rigorous validation across multiple centers to ensure their reliability. Concerns about bias, data privacy, and limited transparency challenge the application of AI decision-making to digital health care. This review discusses the applications of AI in the management of patients with VHD, highlights the future directions of AI technologies, and considers the challenges of integrating AI into clinical practice.",

This review explores the public health strategies deployed across the African continent during the pandemic, highlighting key successes, identifying critical failures, and synthesizing lessons to inform future health emergency preparedness. Drawing on existing literature, policy documents, and epidemiological data, the study examines the roles of leadership, community engagement, health communication, diagnostic capacity, and vaccine deployment. While several African countries successfully leveraged past epidemic experience, decentralized health systems, and innovative communication strategies, others struggled with misinformation, weak surveillance, and limited critical care infrastructure. The review also discusses the role of international collaboration, local innovation, and donor dependence in shaping response outcomes. Lessons from Africa's handling of COVID-19 underline the importance of strengthening public health infrastructure, investing in health workforce development, improving health information systems, and ensuring equitable access to vaccines and therapeutics. This paper contributes to the growing discourse on pandemic preparedness and highlights Africa's potential not only as a site of vulnerability but also of resilience and innovation in global public health.",

Traditional anomaly detection methods often fall short due to their inability to handle the dynamic, heterogeneous, and real-time nature of disaster-related data. These methods typically rely on static models that struggle with integrating continuous data streams from diverse sources like hospitals, emergency services, social media, and environmental sensors. As a result, they often fail to capture sudden shifts in disease patterns, environmental conditions, or population movements, leading to delayed risk identification and suboptimal decisions. The increasing frequency and complexity of natural disasters and pandemics underscore the need for flexible, adaptive systems capable of learning from evolving data. Recent advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics offer promising tools to address these limitations by enabling real-time, high-dimensional data analysis. In recent years, the integration of advanced digital technologies has become essential for improving public health disaster response.",

This growing demographic presents substantial challenges for critical care systems worldwide. However, older patients are frequently underrepresented in clinical research and often receive suboptimal care due to assumptions about low productivity, the presence of multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, and altered physiological responses to illness and treatment. These factors contribute to a paucity of targeted studies and evidence-based guidelines for managing critical illness in geriatric populations. In contrast to younger patients, older adults often place greater emphasis on long-term outcomes and quality of life rather than survival alone.

From 225 participants diagnosed with toxic liver disease within the UK Biobank cohort, data were consolidated, including survival outcomes, clinical phenotypes, comorbidities, and 36 394 genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) focusing on liver-related pathways. Fifteen SNPs were found to be significantly associated with increased mortality risk, notably rs73158145 in the PRKAG2 gene. Predictive models built on these selected SNPs achieved a mean accuracy of 85%, outperforming models without pre-selection (68.9% accuracy).

    "abstract": "Foodborne pathogens remain a significant public health concern, necessitating the development of rapid, sensitive, and reliable detection methods for various food matrices. Traditional biosensors, while effective in many contexts, often face limitations related to complex sample environments, signal interpretation, and on-site usability. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into biosensing platforms offers a transformative approach to address these challenges. This review critically examines recent advancements in AI-assisted biosensors for detecting foodborne pathogens in various food samples, including meat, dairy products, fresh produce, and ready-to-eat foods. Emphasis is placed on the application of machine learning and deep learning to improve biosensor accuracy, reduce detection time, and automate data interpretation. AI models have demonstrated capabilities in enhancing sensitivity, minimizing false results, and enabling real-time, on-site analysis through innovative interfaces. Additionally, the review highlights the types of biosensing mechanisms employed, such as electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric, and how AI optimizes their performance. While these developments show promising outcomes, challenges remain in terms of data quality, algorithm transparency, and regulatory acceptance. The future integration of standardized datasets, explainable AI models, and robust validation protocols will be essential to fully harness the potential of AI-enhanced biosensors for next-generation food safety monitoring.",

Foundation models, originally developed for natural language processing, are now driving transformative approaches to high-dimensional, multimodal single-cell data analysis. Frameworks such as scGPT and scPlantFormer excel in cross-species cell annotation, in silico perturbation modeling, and gene regulatory network inference. Multimodal integration approaches, including pathology-aligned embeddings and tensor-based fusion, harmonize transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial imaging data to delineate multilayered regulatory networks across biological scales. Federated computational platforms facilitate decentralized data analysis and standardized, reproducible workflows, fostering global collaboration. Challenges persist, including technical variability across platforms, limited model interpretability, and gaps in translating computational insights into clinical applications. Overcoming these hurdles demands standardized benchmarking, multimodal knowledge graphs, and collaborative frameworks that integrate artificial intelligence with human expertise. This review synthesizes recent technological advancements and proposes actionable strategies to bridge single-cell multi-omics innovations with mechanistic biology and precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality globally and in Italy, with a growing burden exacerbated by aging populations and underdeveloped strategies for managing chronic cardiovascular conditions. This position paper, resulting from the 2024 ANMCO General Assembly, addresses the current state of cardiovascular chronicity management in Italy, highlighting critical gaps and proposing sustainable, integrative solutions. Despite improvements in acute cardiovascular care, the lack of structured post-acute management, insufficient adoption of secondary prevention protocols, limited access to innovative therapies, and a slow digital transition continue to hinder effective chronic care. The document stresses the pivotal role of cardiologists, not only in acute intervention but also in long-term care and secondary prevention, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary, multichannel healthcare model. The paper explores the potential of e-Health and artificial intelligence to revolutionize chronic disease management. It advocates for the widespread implementation of integrated care pathways, digital tools like electronic health records and telemedicine platforms, which together could enhance early detection, patient monitoring, and therapeutic adherence while reducing unnecessary hospitalizations. It also underscores the necessity of updating national and regional pharmaceutical policies to improve equitable access to disease-modifying therapies. Furthermore, the integration of palliative care in end-stage cardiovascular disease and the enhancement of post-acute care networks are deemed essential. Ultimately, the document advocates for a comprehensive systemic and cultural transformation - spearheaded by scientific societies such as ANMCO - where technological innovation, organizational reform, and patient-centered care align to ensure a sustainable and universally accessible healthcare system. This vision is consistent with the objectives of the PNRR, the 2030 Agenda, and, most importantly, the foundational principles of the Italian Constitution.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic artificial intelligence (AI) represents a paradigm shift in cardiovascular medicine: from prediction to creation. Unlike conventional AI, which analyzes existing data, synthetic AI generates new, patient-like clinical content, signals, images, virtual populations, and personalized treatment simulations, based on learned patterns. This review provides clinicians with a clear and practical overview of core generative technologies, including generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, transformers, diffusion models, autoregressive architectures, digital twins, and synthetic cohort simulators. Each method is illustrated through real-world cardiovascular use cases, from ECG generation to risk stratification, virtual trial design, and procedural planning. Beyond technical explanation, the article explores current regulatory, ethical, and validation challenges, highlighting how synthetic AI can enhance diagnostics, training, and clinical decision-making, particularly in data-limited settings. Far from replacing physicians, these tools extend clinical reach and invite the medical community to take an active role in shaping their responsible use. Synthetic AI is no longer a theoretical innovation, it is a growing infrastructure. Understanding its capabilities, limitations, and clinical relevance will be essential for the cardiologist of tomorrow.",

Conventional diagnostic approaches, including symptom-based questionnaires, empirical acid suppression trials, and single-modality objective tests, demonstrate limited sensitivity and specificity, often resulting in diagnostic inaccuracies and inefficient resource utilization. To overcome these diagnostic challenges, this article provides a systematic review of recent advancements and ongoing debates in GERD diagnostics, with a focus on the diagnostic value of multimodal parameters as outlined in the Lyon Consensus 2.0. It also explores the clinical relevance of emerging auxiliary diagnostic metrics. We emphasize that integrating clinical symptomatology, endoscopic findings, esophageal physiological measurements, and psychosocial factors (augmented by composite scoring systems and artificial intelligence), offers a promising strategy for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment of GERD.",

    "abstract": "Long-term exposure to microgravity influences musculoskeletal health and enhances the likelihood of sustaining orthopedic injuries while on a microgravity mission and upon return to Earth. Although countermeasures are being investigated to alleviate some risks of injury, such as resistive (or weight) exercise and Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP), evidence is accumulating that current paradigms do not ensure the safety or health of astronauts because of a lack of in-flight diagnostic methods, in which load/diagnostic metrics can be assessed over time. Here, we suggest the integration of a new vision-language large language model (DeepSeek-VL) as a potential autonomous diagnostic agent for monitoring musculoskeletal health in a microgravity environment. DeepSeek-VL will autonomously analyze radiographic data and biomechanical data streamed from a LBNP device. Determinations will be made based on lost or compromised density in bone, lost joint-centered stability, or ineffective loading patterns - providing personalized and specific feedback regarding musculoskeletal health with the astronaut as the primary user. Unlike conventional reporting approaches that rely on cross-institutional analysis by household experts, DeepSeek-VL allows for real-time, and autonomous interpretation of musculoskeletal imaging metrics (and physiological metrics) for on-time personalized countermeasure development. Here, we review architectural adaptations including microgravity specific samplings of data, training protocols and implications of deployment in the ISS. We anticipate DeepSeek's timely development of flight-ready diagnostic reporting will facilitate in-flight/systematic monitoring of musculoskeletal health and safety, especially for astronauts undergoing load management training (e.g., LBNP) and ensure effectiveness of countermeasures, their outputs. We will address methods to circumvent limitations and barriers to risk, and establish the importance of a federated, adaptive, and resilient AI-based platform to mitigate risk for astronaut musculoskeletal health during extended missions. Finally, we address some considerations for terrestrial model and a healthcare authority within a current context of growing importance for effective orthopedic healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, uses large datasets to identify patterns between potential predictors and outcomes. ML involves iterative learning from data and is increasingly used in population and public health. Examples include early warning of infectious disease outbreaks, predicting the future burden of noncommunicable diseases, and assessing public health interventions. However, ML can inadvertently produce biased outputs related to the quality and quantity of data, who is engaged and helping direct the analysis, and how findings are interpreted. Specific guidelines for using ML in population and public health have not yet been created. We assembled a diverse team of experts in computer science, statistical modeling, clinical and population health epidemiology, health economics, ethics, sociology, and public health. Drawing on literature reviews and a modified Delphi process, we identified five key recommendations: (1) prioritize partnerships and interventions to support communities considered structurally disadvantaged; (2) use ML for dynamic situations, such as public health emergencies, while adhering to ethical standards; (3) conduct risk assessments and bias mitigation strategies aligned with identified risks; (4) ensure technical transparency and reproducibility by publicly sharing data sources and methodologies; and (5) foster multidisciplinary dialogue to discuss the potential harms of ML-related bias and raise awareness among the public and public health community. The proposed guidelines provide operational steps for stakeholders, ensuring that ML tools are not only effective but also ethically grounded and feasible in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible graphical interfaces. We introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable framework for anomaly detection in biological networks. E-ABIN combines classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating algorithms such as support vector machines, random forests, graph autoencoders, and graph adversarial attributed networks, E-ABIN ensures high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and celiac disease, where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers insights into disease mechanisms. E-ABIN is freely available on the Zenodo platform at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17062501.",

    "abstract": "Mentorship plays a vital role in building research capacity, advancing evidence-based medicine, and fostering innovation in clinical practice, particularly in Africa, where Human Resources for Health (HRH) remain a persistent and complex challenge. Health mentors offer invaluable support by guiding early-career researchers in both clinical and research domains, thereby contributing to the mitigation of healthcare challenges across the continent. Effective mentorship enhances productivity, research quality, and professional networking opportunities. Africa's HRH landscape is marked by significant obstacles, including the brain drain of experienced professionals, outdated research infrastructure, limited funding, and the absence of structured mentorship programs for emerging researchers. The shortage of skilled mentors deprives young professionals of critical guidance, hindering their ability to produce high-quality research and to effectively address pressing local health issues through evidence-based practice. To address these challenges, this article proposes innovative strategies to actively engage young African researchers and establish structured, sustainable mentorship programs that empower them to participate in research-driven decision-making. It also calls on the African Union to adopt policies that prioritize research and allocate dedicated funding for mentorship initiatives. Additionally, leveraging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification can enhance mentorship effectiveness, accessibility, and engagement. Moreover, the promotion of international exchange programs would offer young African researchers valuable exposure, broaden their technical skills, and strengthen global networks. In conclusion, strengthening mentorship frameworks, improving research infrastructure, and investing in the next generation of researchers are critical steps toward addressing Africa's health challenges and advancing its scientific leadership.",

    "abstract": "Environmental challenges such as drought, salinity, heavy metal contamination, and nutrient deficiencies threaten global agricultural productivity and food security. These stressors drastically reduce crop yields, necessitating innovative solutions. Recent advancements in omics-based research-spanning genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and phenomics-have transformed our understanding of plant stress responses at the molecular level. High-throughput sequencing, mass spectrometry, and computational biology have facilitated the identification of stress-responsive genes, proteins, and metabolites critical for enhancing plant resilience. This review evaluates omics-driven strategies for improving crop performance under environmental stress. It emphasizes multi-omics data integration, precision breeding, artificial intelligence (AI) in crop modeling, and genome-editing technologies. Notably, breakthroughs in machine learning and AI have refined predictive modeling, enabling precise selection of stress-tolerant traits and optimizing breeding strategies. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the complexity of multi-omics data analysis, high technology costs, and regulatory barriers. Bridging the gap between research and practical applications requires developing cost-effective platforms, enhancing AI-driven models, and conducting large-scale field validations. This review highlights the transformative potential of omics technologies to develop climate-resilient crops. By integrating these advanced methodologies, agriculture can achieve sustainable food production and bolster global food security in the face of climate change and environmental stressors.",

The chronic pathogenesis of BPD with complex prenatal and postnatal programming challenges attempts at precisely defining or treating disease. While existing BPD definitions categorize disease severity, a lack of consideration of disease heterogeneity and endotypes has contributed to the failure of clinical trials to improve BPD outcomes. Recent studies have used advanced lung imaging techniques, echocardiography, and lung function tests to identify airway, parenchymal, and vascular BPD endotypes. These endotypes carry different prognoses and require endotype-specific treatment strategies to optimize infant outcomes. In this Review, we focus on the pathogenic mechanisms that specify individual BPD endotypes and discuss how combining biomarkers, functional studies, and artificial intelligence-based characterization of endotypes can inform precision therapies for BPD.",

    "abstract": "Chemical staining methods, while reliable, are time consuming and can be resource-intensive, involving costly chemical reagents and raising environmental concerns. This underscores the compelling need for alternative solutions such as virtual staining, which not only accelerates the diagnostic process but also enhances the flexibility of stain applications without the associated physical and chemical costs. Generative artificial intelligence technologies prove to be immensely useful in addressing these challenges. However, in healthcare, particularly within computational pathology, the high-stakes nature of decisions complicates the adoption of these tools due to their often opaque processes. Our work introduces an innovative approach that harnesses generative models for virtual stain transformations, improving performance, trustworthiness, scalability, and adaptability within computational pathology. The core of the proposed methodology involves a singular Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) encoder that supports multiple stain decoders. This design prioritizes critical regions in the latent space of H&E tissues, leading to a richer representation that enables precise synthetic stain generation by the decoders. Tested to simultaneously generate eight different stains from a single H&E slide, our method also offers significant scalability benefits for routine use by loading only necessary model components during production. We integrate label-free knowledge during training, using loss functions and regularization to minimize artifacts, thereby enhancing the accuracy of virtual staining in both paired and unpaired settings. To build trust in these synthetic stains, we employ a real-time self-inspection methodology using trained discriminators for each stain type, providing pathologists with confidence heatmaps to aid in their evaluations. In addition, we perform automatic quality checks on new H&E slides to ensure that they conform to the trained H&E distribution, guaranteeing the generation of high-quality synthetic stained slides. Recognizing the challenges pathologists face in adopting new technologies, we have encapsulated our method in an open-source, cloud-based proof-of-concept system. This system enables users to easily and virtually stain their H&E slides through a browser, eliminating the need for specialized technical knowledge and addressing common hardware and software challenges. It also facilitates real-time user feedback integration. Lastly, we have curated a novel dataset comprising eight different paired H&E/stains related to pediatric Crohn's disease at diagnosis, providing 30 whole slide images (WSIs) for each stain set (total of 480 WSIs) to stimulate further research in computational pathology.",

    "abstract": "Violence risk assessment is a critical component of psychiatric practice, with significant clinical, ethical, and legal implications. Psychiatric patients at high risk of violence often face interventions including restraints, intramuscular injections, and involuntary hospitalization. Agitated and aggressive behaviours from patients have been linked to high hospital costs due to increased length of stay, readmissions, increased medication use, staff injury, and need for high acuity monitoring. Traditional risk assessment tools can be time intensive and have poor generalizability to civil populations. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential for enhancing the precision of violence risk assessments. Although AI can address the technical issues of risk assessment, its implementation will raise new ethical and legal challenges. In psychiatry, AI-assisted violence risk assessment intersects with mental health law, particularly criteria for preventive detention and the ethical boundaries of AI-driven decisions. There have been some early concerns about racial bias, lack of transparency, accountability, and disruption to current practices in psychiatric care. To our knowledge, there have been no efforts to synthesize the ethical and legal implications for this particular use case. To address these gaps, we conducted a scoping review to map the literature on the ethical and legal considerations of AI in violence risk assessment in acute psychiatry.",

This has led to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes in African populations and overall scarcity of relevant pharmacogenetic data, including characteristic genotypes as well as drugs prescribed in the continent to treat infectious diseases. Here, we propose a general approach to identify drug-gene pairs with potential pharmacogenetic interest. Our pipeline couples machine learning and artificial intelligence with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and non-linear mixed effects (NLME) modelling to hypothesize which pharmacogenes could be of potential clinical interest, and which dose adjustments could be made to provide better treatment outcomes for African populations. Drug-gene pairs are first ranked with the latest knowledge embedding techniques, based on public structural and bioactivity data for drugs and genes, followed by a large language model-based refinement. Selected genes are then evaluated for their sensitivity in PBPK analysis, and relevant variants subsequently inspected with NLME for dose optimization. The analysis is focused on genes with potential clinical relevance in Africa. We delve deeper into malaria and tuberculosis therapies, many of which remain uncharacterised from a pharmacogenetic perspective.",

This article systematically reviews the latest progress of multimodal AI technology in the diagnosis, treatment, and decision-making for gastrointestinal tumors, functional gastrointestinal diseases, and liver diseases, focusing on the innovative applications of endoscopic image AI, pathological section AI, multi-omics data fusion models, and wearable devices combined with natural language processing. Multimodal AI can significantly improve the accuracy of early diagnosis and the efficiency of individualized treatment planning by integrating imaging, pathological data, molecular, and clinical phenotypic data. However, current AI technologies still face challenges such as insufficient data standardization, limited generalization of models, and ethical compliance. This paper proposes solutions, such as the establishment of cross-center data sharing platform, the development of federated learning framework, and the formulation of ethical norms, and looks forward to the application prospect of multimodal large-scale models in the disease management process. This review provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for promoting the clinical translation of AI technology in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a recently developed artificial intelligence (AI)-based language model that has become an increasingly common source of health-related information due to its accessibility. However, there is limited evidence regarding the accuracy and reliability of its responses. Objective: This study aimed to assess ChatGPT’s usability in otolaryngology by analyzing its answers to common patient questions. Method: 24 patient-oriented questions were created across 10 otolaryngological disease categories and submitted sequentially to ChatGPT version 4.0. The generated responses were evaluated from a linguistic perspective and 6 board-certified otolaryngologists using a three-point scale: incorrect (1), correct but incomplete (2), and correct (3). Results: Language evaluations indicated that the responses were generally clear, well-structured, and of good quality for further medical evaluations. ChatGPT’s medical accuracy scores ranged from 2.00 to 2.83. Three specific questions (Q4, Q9, Q24) received significantly lower ratings. Four raters (R1, R2, R4, R6) showed strong agreement in their evaluations, while significant differences emerged between the scores of R3 and R5 (p<0.001). Conclusion: ChatGPT’s responses in otolaryngology were coherent and well-structured, but the accuracy of medical content varied by topic. While the tool may be beneficial for basic patient education, it is not currently reliable enough to support clinical decision-making. Future development of validated, specialty-specific artificial intelligence systems based on trustworthy medical sources will be crucial for safe implementation in healthcare.

    "abstract": "The ophthalmic route for drug administration remains a significant constraint in ophthalmology due to the unique anatomy and several protective barriers in the eyes, which limit absorption and therapeutic efficacy. Conventionally, drugs are delivered to the eye through various types of formulations, including eye drops (solutions, suspensions, and emulsions), ointments and gels, in-situ gels, and periocular injections. While effective, they suffer from various drawbacks, including poor bioavailability (<5%), reflex blinking, tear turnover, nasolacrimal drainage, and frequent dosing requirements. A key challenge remains: ensuring sufficient drug reaches the target area for the desired effect. This necessitates developing sophisticated drug delivery systems capable of site-specific controlled release within the ocular tissue, including implantable and insertable devices. In 2024, the global ocular implant market reached a valuation of USD 15.72 billion and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5.8 % from 2025 to 2030, fuelled by increasing demand for minimally invasive and long-acting treatment options. These devices are not only used for sustained and controlled drug delivery but also play an important role in correcting refractive error through intraocular lenses. Recent advancements, including artificial intelligence, IoTconnected devices, smart stimuli-responsive materials, and precision 3D printing, are significantly enhancing the diagnostic, monitoring, and management purposes of ocular conditions in modern ophthalmic care. This review provides a detailed analysis of various implantable and insertable technologies, ranging from Intacs rings, ocular ring inserts, and drug-eluting contact lenses to intracameral implants, conjunctival inserts, intraocular lenses/inlays, injected micro- and nanoparticles, intravitreal implants, and microneedles. For each category, we examine the working mechanisms, clinical applications, technological innovations, and design considerations, with a focus on segmented drug delivery for the anterior and posterior regions. The review also highlights clinical applications, provides an overview of marketed, patented, and FDA-approved devices in the U.S., and outlines ongoing clinical trials. Additionally, it addresses the difficulties in translating research into clinical practice, recent technological advancements, and future directions for navigating regulatory barriers in the development of these devices. Through highlighting critical research gaps, this review intends to influence the advancement of ocular implants and inserts. This article aims to guide future developments in the domain of ocular therapeutics through implantable and insertable drug delivery devices.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic radiologists are uniquely positioned to make a difference in the reduction of diagnostic errors in medicine, which was identified as a national priority in a special report of the National Academies of Medicine in 2015. Interest in diagnostic error reduction within the specialty of diagnostic radiology has been accelerated in recent years by the adoption of rapidly evolving technological and process-based solutions for previously identified vulnerabilities (i.e., potential failure modes) in the radiology workflow that are known to increase the risk of errors. Here we describe a range of such potential failure modes contributing to diagnostic error in the practice of diagnostic radiology and summarize evolving efforts to mitigate them. These include fostering the adoption of peer learning and other feedback and education programs, a range of measures under development for ongoing performance evaluation of radiologists and their work-processes, and the deployment of new technologies, most notably artificial intelligence tools, to augment human performance and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy in Radiology.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence from the CHALLENGE trial confirms that structured exercise can significantly improve survival outcomes in colon cancer survivors, reinforcing the principle that exercise is medicine. However, implementing personalized and scalable rehabilitation programs remains challenging. This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI), when integrated with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, can transform cancer rehabilitation through personalized exercise prescriptions, real-time monitoring, virtual coaching, and data-driven decision-making. We also discuss the role of emerging technologies such as virtual reality, wearables, and telehealth in expanding access to care. While limitations regarding data bias, equity, and regulation persist, strategic research and implementation efforts are essential.

    "abstract": "Taste peptides have emerged as promising natural flavoring agents attributed to their unique organoleptic properties, high safety profile, and potential health benefits. However, the de novo identification of taste peptides derived from animal, plant, or microbial sources remains a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, significantly impeding their widespread application in the food industry. In this work, we present TastePepAI, a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework for customized taste peptide design and safety assessment. As the key element of this framework, a loss-supervised adaptive variational autoencoder (LA-VAE) is implemented to efficiently optimize the latent representation of sequences during training and facilitate the generation of target peptides with desired taste profiles. Notably, our model incorporates a novel taste-avoidance mechanism, allowing for selective flavor exclusion. Subsequently, our in-house developed toxicity prediction algorithm (SpepToxPred) is integrated in the framework to undergo rigorous safety evaluation of generated peptides. Using this integrated platform, we successfully identified 73 peptides exhibiting sweet, salty, and umami, significantly expanding the current repertoire of taste peptides. This work demonstrates the potential of TastePepAI in accelerating taste peptide discovery for food applications and provides a versatile framework adaptable to broader peptide engineering challenges.",
