    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, remains a chronic management challenge despite the success of biological therapies such as infliximab. A major limitation is secondary loss of response, which affects a substantial proportion of patients and complicates long-term treatment strategies. Emerging technologies such as radiomics, which converts medical images into quantitative features, and artificial intelligence (AI), which integrates complex multimodal data, offer new opportunities to predict treatment response, monitor disease activity, and personalize therapy. By combining imaging-derived radiomic features with clinical and laboratory information, AI-driven models can provide early, actionable insights to guide therapeutic decisions. This editorial discusses the promise and limitations of these approaches, emphasizing how they can be integrated into clinical decision-making pathways. While challenges in standardization, validation, and clinician adoption remain, radiomics and AI represent important steps toward precision medicine, with the potential to improve outcomes and optimize care for patients with IBD.",

Outlining a futuristic AI-driven interventional radiology (IR) workflow may help to narrow and redefine the wide range of theoretical applications. In this future workflow, diagnosis and preprocedural planning may be semiautomated and guided by an AI-driven multidisciplinary tumor board, outcome prediction analysis, noninvasive imaging biopsy, personalized therapeutics, and simulations. Ablations will include automatic segmentation, integrated registration, optimized device selection and trajectory prescription, robotic stereotaxy for large composite treatment volumes, AI response criteria, multimodality fusion, and iterative sphere packing to improve end-to-end procedural management. Additionally, AI virtual outcome prediction software will enable preplanning of robotic endovascular interventions with prescriptive maneuvers that minimize risk and time under anesthesia. Responsible integration of AI technologies will further the mission of IR to make medicine more personalized, minimally invasive, cost-effective, and safe.",

    "abstract": "Oncology clinical trials play a pivotal role in the development of new therapeutic options; however, their implementation remains an extremely costly and time-consuming process. Artificial intelligence can open new horizons in the design and conduct of clinical trials, particularly in early phases, where safety, dose planning, and patient recruitment efficiency are critical. This paper aims to explore the potential applications of artificial intelligence in various stages of early-phase oncology trials, including biostatistical design, patient enrollment, and quality assurance aspects. Based on case studies and examples from the literature, it can be concluded that artificial intelligence can assist with precise protocol design, shorten recruitment timelines, and improve predictive performance in dose planning and patient selection, thereby reducing the number of adverse events. At the same time, regulatory, ethical, and data protection challenges remain significant barriers to the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence. Integrating artificial intelligence into clinical trials requires not only technological but also strategic-level modernization, from the industrial companies and authorities as well. The reliable and validated application of artificial intelligence could represent a major advancement in clinical research, particularly in increasing the success rate of early-phase trials.

    "abstract": "Rectal cancer presents complex surgical challenges due to the confined pelvic anatomy. Robotic-assisted surgery has gained prominence for its enhanced precision, dexterity, and ergonomics compared to conventional laparoscopy. This bibliometric analysis examined 598 English-language publications from 2006 to 2025 indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace and VOS viewer were used to map global research trends, institutional networks, and author contributions. The United States, Japan, and China were identified as leading contributors, with Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo University of Science, and Cleveland Clinic among the top institutions. Yusuke Kinugasa, Akio Shiomi, and Hiroyasu Kagawa were the most prolific authors. Early research focused on technical feasibility and learning curves, while recent studies emphasize survival outcomes, risk stratification, and comparisons with open resection. Emerging themes include functional preservation, nerve-sparing techniques, and integration of artificial intelligence and intraoperative imaging. The field is evolving toward personalized, multidisciplinary care. Despite technological advances, broader adoption and stronger institutional collaboration remain essential to fully realize the potential of robotic rectal cancer surgery.",

    "abstract": "Cancer's staggering molecular heterogeneity demands innovative approaches beyond traditional single-omics methods. The integration of multi-omics data, spanning genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and radiomics, can improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy when accompanied by rigorous preprocessing and external validation; for example, recent integrated classifiers report AUCs around 0.81-0.87 for difficult early-detection tasks. This review synthesizes how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning and machine learning, bridges this gap by enabling scalable, non-linear integration of disparate omics layers into clinically actionable insights. We explore cutting-edge AI methodologies, including graph neural networks for biological network modeling, transformers for cross-modal fusion, and explainable AI (XAI) for transparent clinical decision support. Critical applications are highlighted, such as AI-driven therapy selection (e.g., predicting targeted therapy resistance), proteogenomic early detection, and radiogenomic non-invasive diagnostics. We further address translational challenges: data harmonization, batch correction, missing data imputation, and computational scalability. Emerging trends, federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, spatial/single-cell omics for microenvironment decoding, quantum computing, and patient-centric \"N-of-1\" models, signal a paradigm shift toward dynamic, personalized cancer management. Despite persistent hurdles in model generalizability, ethical equity, and regulatory alignment, AI-powered multi-omics integration promises to transform precision oncology from reactive population-based approaches to proactive, individualized care.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping neurology, offering opportunities to improve efficiency, expand access to care, and enhance clinical decision making. Yet, without deliberate safeguards, AI can perpetuate or exacerbate existing health disparities, especially for systemically marginalized populations. This article examines the dual potential of AI, as both a driver of innovation and a source of bias, in the context of neurologic care. Drawing on literature review, stakeholder consultations, and practical examples, we outline the risks of AI worsening health disparities stemming from biased data sets, nonrepresentative training populations, and opaque algorithms. We also highlight opportunities for AI to promote health equity, including early disease detection in underserved settings, language-access tools, improved clinical trial diversity, and targeted quality improvement interventions. We propose 3 guiding principles for the neurology community to ensure that AI serves as a driver of equity: (1) ensuring diverse perspectives and community engagement in AI development; (2) expanding AI education and training for neurologists; and (3) establishing ethical policy and governance mechanisms. These recommendations are intended for clinicians, researchers, educators, health system leaders, policymakers, and professional societies and provide actionable strategies to integrate equity into every stage of AI design, implementation, and oversight. By centering inclusion, transparency, and accountability, AI can be harnessed to improve equitable access to high-quality neurologic care and to address long-standing disparities in neurologic health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) demonstrates distinctive advantages in disease prevention and treatment. However, analyzing its biological mechanisms through the modern medical research paradigm of \"single drug, single target\" presents significant challenges due to its holistic approach. Network pharmacology and its core theory of network targets connect drugs and diseases from a holistic and systematic perspective based on biological networks, overcoming the limitations of reductionist research models and showing considerable value in TCM research. Recent integration of network target computational and experimental methods with artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-modal multi-omics technologies has substantially enhanced network pharmacology methodology. The advancement in computational and experimental techniques provides complementary support for network target theory in decoding TCM principles. This review, centered on network targets, examines the progress of network target methods combined with AI in predicting disease molecular mechanisms and drug-target relationships, alongside the application of multi-modal multi-omics technologies in analyzing TCM formulae, syndromes, and toxicity. Looking forward, network target theory is expected to incorporate emerging technologies while developing novel approaches aligned with its unique characteristics, potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in TCM research and advancing scientific understanding and innovation in TCM.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) represents a paradigmatic approach to personalized medicine, developed through the systematic accumulation and refinement of clinical empirical data over more than 2000 years, and now encompasses large-scale electronic medical records (EMR) and experimental molecular data. Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its utility in medicine through the development of various expert systems (e.g., MYCIN) since the 1970s. With the emergence of deep learning and large language models (LLMs), AI's potential in medicine shows considerable promise. Consequently, the integration of AI and TCM from both clinical and scientific perspectives presents a fundamental and promising research direction. This survey provides an insightful overview of TCM AI research, summarizing related research tasks from three perspectives: systems-level biological mechanism elucidation, real-world clinical evidence inference, and personalized clinical decision support. The review highlights representative AI methodologies alongside their applications in both TCM scientific inquiry and clinical practice. To critically assess the current state of the field, this work identifies major challenges and opportunities that constrain the development of robust research capabilities-particularly in the mechanistic understanding of TCM syndromes and herbal formulations, novel drug discovery, and the delivery of high-quality, patient-centered clinical care. The findings underscore that future advancements in AI-driven TCM research will rely on the development of high-quality, large-scale data repositories; the construction of comprehensive and domain-specific knowledge graphs (KGs); deeper insights into the biological mechanisms underpinning clinical efficacy; rigorous causal inference frameworks; and intelligent, personalized decision support systems.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious threat to global public health. Anti-coronavirus peptides (ACVPs) exhibit high targeting, low toxicity, and excellent modifiability, making them promising candidates for antiviral drug discovery. These properties offer advantages over traditional small-molecule drugs. To reduce the time and cost spent on large-scale peptide screening and activity validation, there is an urgent need to construct efficient artificial intelligence models that assist in the identification of ACVPs. However, the limited number of experimentally validated ACVPs severely constrains the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of existing computational models. In this study, a new prediction framework, the Multi-modal Feature Extraction and Ensemble learning framework for Anti-Coronavirus Peptide prediction(MFE-ACVP), is proposed for identifying potential candidate peptides for ACVPs. The method generates high-quality ACVPs by introducing an improved Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with materialization constraints to alleviate the problem of data insufficiency. Simultaneously, fusing sequence, structural, evolutionary, and topological features, we constructed a 100-dimensional cross-scale feature representation. An ensemble architecture integrating five traditional machine learning models with deep neural networks (DNNs) was designed to enhance predictive performance. Compared with the existing models PreAntiCoV, iACVP, ACVPred, and ENNAVIA-C/D, MFE-ACVP achieved 86.37%, 77.62%, and 65.19% of area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively, on an independent validation set, showing superior predictive performance and stability. To facilitate ACVP screening, we developed a publicly accessible web server http://bioprediction.sa1.tunnelfrp.com/.",

We developed a 27 open-ended survey including five core domains of PP, such as diagnosis, etiology, diagnostics, treatment, and prevention. DeepSeek V3, Gemini 2.0, and ChatGPT-3.5, were each provided with identical reference materials. Two pediatric infectious disease specialists independently assessed responses using a structured 10-point rubric through Licert, which presents a custom evaluation tool. DeepSeek V3 achieved the highest mean score (9.9), outperforming ChatGPT-3.5 (7.7), and Gemini 2.0 (7.5) through all domains (p < 0.001). Moreover, it received a full score in 26 out of 27 questions (96.3%) and achieved an accuracy score of  ≥ 5. In addition, the highest performance appeared in higher-order reasoning areas, including age-specific etiology and imaging interpretation, with DeepSeek V3 outperforming others by up to 3.2 points. While all models demonstrated almost safety, the variability in content quality however highlights the necessity for careful platform selection. Therefore, future research should explore educational outcomes comparing AI-assisted and conventional learning approaches to better define the role of LLMs in medical education.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cases are projected to hit 35 million worldwide by 2050, posing a significant burden on health care systems. The cancer care continuum has evolved to precision medicine practices, provisioning personalized treatments based on multimodal and multiomics data. Contextual analysis of such diverse, voluminous, spatiotemporal patient data is beyond human cognitive capacity. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are reshaping the data mining paradigm in healthcare by delivering novel data-led insights in real time. AI-based methods for cancer risk predictions, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics are developed, validated, and approved, indicating readiness for integration in clinical workflows. Additional validation of AI models using real-world data representing diverse populations is recommended to address clinical, technical, regulatory, ethical, and legal challenges, along with trust issues. Integrating AI tools into cancer care workflows to augment clinical decision-making, without compromising clinical autonomy and patient safety, is essential to address the increasing demand for cancer care by 2050.",

In biomedicine and oncology, Gen-AI tools are forming the foundation for intuitive patient-facing and clinician-facing interfaces that increase accessibility and efficiency of health care applications, enhance patient experience, and improve clinical workflows, ultimately optimizing patient outcomes. Despite Gen-AI's great potential in health care, limitations related to data quality and learning algorithms can create persistent challenges to patient safety, warranting a thorough HMI evaluation by end-users and experts that goes beyond traditional statistical validation.

    "abstract": "A new branch of artificial intelligence called Active Inference AI is changing the very foundations of how medical knowledge is created, applied, and taught. And this new AI is combining with an entirely new evolution of the Internet, called the Spatial Web, which is changing how medical knowledge will be shared globally. Active Inference AI and the Spatial Web have been developed together to create a powerful new environment for medicine and science in general to evolve to an entirely new level. Until now, large-scale AI models called LLMs (Large Language Models) have been dominating the AI marketplace. But these are general-purpose AIs. They are expensive to create, they are massively data-hungry, and they are imprecise and not designed for specialized domains like medicine. In contrast, this new Active Inference AI-inspired by neuroscience-is designed specifically for medicine and other applications requiring high accuracy and explainable results. This new AI does not use LLM technology but relies on small, domain-specific models built from expert-curated knowledge graphs and factor graphs. This novel approach enables reasoning, learning, and decision-making within well-defined medical contexts, allowing for the precision, adaptability, and interpretability missing in LLMs. This report outlines how Active Inference AI can: (1) accelerate medical research by simulating hypotheses and causal pathways. (2) Enhance medical treatment through adaptive, real-time digital twins and precision diagnostics. (3) Revolutionize medical education by creating dynamic, interactive, and semantically accurate learning environments.",

Machine learning (ML) models analyze historical and real-world data to optimize eligibility criteria, simulate in silico cohorts, flag protocol risks, and recommend real-time adaptations. Natural language processing enhances patient screening by extracting patient data from electronic health records to match diverse patient populations to trials faster than traditional methods. AI-driven analysis of data from electronic wearables and imaging enables early toxicity and efficacy signals, allowing providers real-time monitoring. However, the same code that accelerates technology can also amplify bias, increase data security issues, hallucinate unsafe recommendations, and raise legal and ethical alarms. Safeguards, including transparent model reporting, bias mitigation, robust cybersecurity, clinician oversight, and education for providers and patients, are essential.

    "abstract": "Foundation models (FMs) represent a transformative advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), with growing applications in medical imaging. These models leverage self-attention mechanisms and are capable of processing multimodal data, such as images, text, audio, and video, across multiple scales. Although FMs require large datasets for initial training, they can be adapted to specific medical imaging tasks using smaller labeled datasets through techniques such as transfer learning, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and zero-shot learning, making them especially valuable in data-scarce settings. Many FMs also incorporate generative AI capabilities that support the creation of synthetic medical images to further address annotation limitations. Current applications span various imaging modalities in radiology, where FMs have shown potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and streamline workflows. However, clinical integration remains challenging due to issues such as limited interpretability, potential bias, privacy concerns, regulatory constraints, high computational costs, and domain shifts between training data and real-world clinical environments. Addressing these barriers will require coordinated efforts among technical developers, health care providers, and regulatory bodies. This review explores the evolving role of FMs and generative AI in radiology, highlighting recent research advances, clinical applications, and the key challenges that must be addressed for responsible deployment.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects more than 250 million people. It is a heterogeneous disease with a variety of symptoms, severity, and underlying mechanisms. Long term remission has been achieved for small subgroups of people with asthma treated with targeted biologic therapy. Accurately defining asthma subgroups is therefore of upmost importance for further reducing the prevalence of asthma. The rapid rise in technologies that enable profiling of a spectrum of analytes provides the opportunity to accurately classify asthma subtypes and to elucidate the underlying causes of disease. Combining these technologies with artificial intelligence will enable more accurate disease prediction, precision diagnoses, and personalised treatments. A major challenge is the prioritisation and effective implementation of these technologies in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive imaging of skin diseases is highly valued in both dermatological research and practice. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is primarily applied to assess melanocytic lesions because of its high resolution, whereas optical coherence tomography (OCT) is particularly used for non-melanocytic skin tumors owing to its greater penetration depth. Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) combines the techniques of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), enabling visualization of the skin down to the superficial dermis while simultaneously providing cellular resolution. The visualization of the skin changes can be done horizontally, vertically, in 3D mode or as a video in real time. The evaluation of the measurement can be supported by artificial intelligence if required. The field of application of LC-OCT includes both melanocytic and non-melanocytic lesions. In addition, preliminary studies show great potential in the diagnosis and therapy control of inflammatory and infectious skin diseases. Nevertheless, RCM and OCT still have their place in special cases such as tumors requiring a particularly high resolution or penetration depth > 500 µm.",

This review synthesizes recent advancements across molecular pathogenesis, precision diagnostics, and therapeutic innovations. Key findings reveal that PDRA pathophysiology involves pregnancy-induced hormonal fluctuations, extracellular matrix remodeling, and mechanical overloading, necessitating individualized management. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced ultrasonography achieves superior diagnostic accuracy (Dice score: 85.93%, r = 0.944 vs. manual measurements) over traditional methods, while minimally invasive techniques including laparoscopic \"Slim-Mesh\" repair demonstrate reduced recurrence rates (< 10%) and enhanced recovery compared to open surgery. Biomaterial integration (such as synthetic and bioabsorbable meshes) promotes anatomical reconstruction. Intelligent rehabilitation systems combining surface electromyography and wearable sensors improve inter-rectus distance (IRD) reduction through real-time biomechanical feedback. Critical challenges persist regarding the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, long-term outcome validation of emerging technologies (> 5-year follow-up gaps), and optimization of AI-driven predictive models. We propose a potential precision medicine framework that integrates dynamic imaging, molecular profiling, and patient-specific interventions to optimize functional recovery and address heterogeneity in PDRA management.",

This review synthesizes the current workflow-from image acquisition and segmentation to feature extraction and modeling-and emphasizes clinical use cases: triage when tissue is limited, risk stratification, therapy selection (including immunotherapy), and longitudinal monitoring. Despite promising results, clinical translation is constrained by non-standardized imaging/feature pipelines, limited multi-center validation and calibration, vulnerability to data leakage, and challenges in interpretability, uncertainty handling, and software and model governance. We advocate treating genomic burden-tumor mutational burden (TMB), intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), and copy-number alterations (CNA)-as first-class endpoints and covariates, and outline a pattern-aware framework for EGFR T790M to inform surveillance and treatment sequencing. We also provide a practical reporting checklist and a pitfall-to-remedy table to support reproducible, multi-center studies and regulatory-grade documentation. Radiogenomics is best viewed as a complement to biopsy rather than a replacement. Real-world impact now depends on harmonized protocols, leakage-free external validation, explainable and uncertainty-aware models, and integration with multi-omics decision support to deliver reliable, patient-centered lung cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Clinical documentation burden remains a significant challenge in healthcare, particularly in primary care settings. Artificial intelligence (AI) scribes have emerged as potential solutions, but their effectiveness compared to human documentation lacks robust evidence, especially in community general practice environments. Documentation quality is compared between four commercial AI scribes and human-generated notes using four standardised clinical scenarios from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners examination repository in simulated general practice consultations. Three experienced general practitioners, blinded to the source, assessed quality using a modified Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI-9). AI-generated notes outperformed human documentation across multiple quality domains. Top AI scribes scored a mean of 44.08/50 (SD = 3.32) vs. 37.42 (SD = 9.78) for humans, excelling in thoroughness (M = 4.92), accuracy (M = 4.67), and freedom from bias (M = 4.92). Inter-rater reliability was high for thoroughness (ICC = 0.879) and accuracy (ICC = 0.745), but lower for subjective areas like synthesis (ICC = 0.082). This study shows that AI scribes can outperform traditional documentation in simulated general practice. Successful implementation, however, depends on workflow integration and customisation. Standardised evaluation and balancing consistency with clinical context are key. Future research should explore real-world use, focusing on customisation and workflow impact.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the United States. Traditional management based on intermittent clinic visits and subjective symptom reporting often fails to detect early decompensation. Remote monitoring technologies-both invasive and noninvasive-are emerging as transformative tools for continuous, real-world surveillance of physiological parameters to guide heart failure management. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current and evolving landscape of remote hemodynamic monitoring, including left atrial, pulmonary artery, and inferior vena cava pressure sensors, as well as cardiovascular implantable electronic devices and wearable systems. Devices such as the CardioMEMS and Cordella have demonstrated decreases in heart failure hospitalizations and improvements in quality of life through hemodynamic-guided therapy. Noninvasive technologies, including patch-based sensors, wearable monitors, and artificial intelligence-driven voice analysis platforms, show promise for broader scalability. Despite demonstrated benefits, adoption remains limited owing to data integration challenges, reimbursement barriers, and a lack of standardized clinical workflows. To fully realize the potential of remote monitoring, strategies must focus on patient engagement, closed-loop feedback systems, integration with electronic health records, and personalized algorithms. A tiered approach that matches monitoring intensity to disease severity may optimize outcomes and transform heart failure care into a proactive, patient-centered model.",

    "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an autoimmune prompted skin disorder, whose hallmarks include the unpredictable onset of hives and itch. Symptom duration typically exceed 6 weeks, and flares can occur for up to 5 years or longer if untreated, impacting potentially any area of the body. The absence of obvious triggers and the variation in onset frequency often delays formal diagnosis which on average is approximately 2 years from first presentation. Initial standard of care is the use of low through to higher strength antihistamines in the first instance, with eventual escalation to prescription anti-inflammatory agents and potentially biologics once patients are under managed care. The societal impacts of delays in diagnosis are marked, with data suggesting CSU impacts up to 1% of the population, primarily of working age and with twice the prevalence in women. Herein, we advocate for the deployment of smartphone imaging and generative artificial intelligence technology to improve detection and early management of CSU through integrated self-care approaches. Such approaches embodying the tenets of P4 personalized medicine could have sustained impact on the disease through awareness campaigns, reducing the burden on the dermatology community and facilitating earlier access to curative therapeutic interventions.",

Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal Deep Learning model for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data, rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates good performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute the most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reshaping microbiology, enabling rapid antibiotic discovery, resistance prediction and clinical diagnostics. For microbiologists, the goal is not to build new algorithms but to recognize when ML is appropriate, how to prepare data and how to interpret outputs responsibly. This primer takes that practical stance - driving the ML car rather than rebuilding the engine. At a high level, ML learns from complex patterns, often noisy data. In antibiotic discovery, ML models help identify compounds in biological data and design new ones from scratch using generative AI. In microbiome studies, where measurements are compositional, sparse and often confounded, ML helps uncover community structure and link taxa or functions to phenotypes. In pathogen genomics, supervised models map sequence-derived features (e.g. k‑mers, SNPs and gene presence/absence) to outcomes such as species identity, antimicrobial susceptibility or MIC. Unsupervised learning supports exploration, including clustering, latent gradients and dimensionality reduction for visualization. Across these settings, success hinges less on exotic architectures than on sound problem framing, careful preprocessing and experimental validation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually transforming healthcare. However, despite its promised benefits, AI in healthcare also raises a number of ethical, legal and social concerns. Compliance by design (CbD) has been proposed as one way of addressing some of these concerns. In the context of healthcare, CbD efforts could focus on building compliance with existing clinical guidelines (CGs), given that they provide the best practices identified according to evidence-based medicine. In this paper we use the example of AI-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to theoretically examine whether medical AI tools could be designed to be inherently compliant with CGs, and implication for ethics and trust. We argue that AI-based CDSS systematically complying with CGs when applied to specific patient cases are not desirable, as CGs, despite their usefulness in guiding medical decision-making, are only recommendations on how to diagnose and treat medical conditions. We thus propose a new understanding of CbD for CGs as a sociotechnical program supported by AI that applies to the whole clinical decision-making process rather than just understanding CbD for CGs as a process located only within the AI tool. This implies taking into account emerging knowledge from actual clinical practices to put CGs in perspective, reflexivity from users regarding the information needed for decision-making, as well as a shift in the design culture, from AI as a stand-alone tool to AI as an in-situ service located within particular healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic zonation reflects the concept that hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells (NPCs) perform distinct metabolic functions, depending on their spatial localization along the porto-central axis. The maintenance of this fine-tuned organization is essential for liver homeostasis, and its disruption may contribute to liver diseases, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Fat overload perturbs zonal gene signatures, lipid handling and oxygen/metabolite gradients progressively leading to steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis and HCC, conditions in which the hepatic architecture is lost. Traditional approaches have provided valuable insights into zonation, although they lack the spatial resolution and mask the heterogeneity of NPCs. Thus, the premise of this review is to discuss how spatial omics can redefine our understanding of hepatic zonation by integrating tissue mapping with metabolic organization, specifically focusing on MASLD. The advent of spatial omics accelerates knowledge regarding MASLD pathophysiology, providing more informative insights into transcriptional/translational/lipidomic/metabolomics zone-specific perturbations. Emerging spatial genomics and epigenomics applications further expand this scenario, allowing for the capture of chromatin remodeling in situ. The integration of these state-of-the-art approaches, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI)-based analyses, is promising in the clinic, as it may provide novel zonal prognostic biomarkers and pave the way for precision-medicine strategies targeting zonal switching.",

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled abnormal cell growth, referred to as cancer, can result in tumors, other fatal disabilities, and immune system deterioration. Typically, the treatment procedure is longer and extremely expensive owing to its higher recurrence and death rates. Early and precise detection and assessment of cancer are significant for improving patient survival rates. Moreover, initial cancer detection makes the treatment simpler and improves the rate of recovery, leading to a lower mortality rate. Gene expression data plays an important part in cancer classification at the initial phase. Precise cancer classification is a challenging and complex task because of the high-dimensional nature of gene expression data, coupled with the small sample size. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have recently developed fundamental models utilizing AI methods to diagnose and predict cancer. These techniques now play a leading role in increasing the precision of survival predictions, cancer susceptibility, and recurrence. This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence-Based Multimodal Approach for Cancer Genomics Diagnosis Using Optimized Significant Feature Selection Technique (AIMACGD-SFST) model. The aim is to develop precise and effective techniques for cancer genomics analysis using advanced computational and analytical techniques. The preprocessing stage comprises min-max normalization, handling missing values, encoding target labels, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Furthermore, the AIMACGD-SFST model employs the coati optimization algorithm (COA) method for feature selection process to choose the related features from the dataset. Finally, the ensemble models, namely deep belief network (DBN), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and variational stacked autoencoder (VSAE) are employed for the classification process. The experimental validation of the AIMACGD-SFST approach is performed under three diverse datasets. The comparison study of the AIMACGD-SFST approach illustrated superior accuracy value of 97.06%, 99.07%, and 98.55% over existing models under diverse datasets.",

Machine learning, particularly deep neural networks (NNs), address these challenges by learning transcriptional patterns, reconstructing expression profiles and effectively classifying cells but often lacks interpretability. Recent advances in explainable AI (XAI) offer tools to clarify model decisions. Yet pinpointing differentially regulated genes with these tools remains challenging. We introduce a novel method to identify differentially explained genes (DXGs) based on importance scores derived from custom-built NNs. We highlight the superiority of DXGs in identifying HF subtypes-specific pathways that provide new insights into different types of HF.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, global political efforts have increasingly focused on the transformative potential of personalized medicine to prevent disease, improve health outcomes, and lower treatment costs. This has created at pressing demand for healthcare professionals to deepen their understanding and utilizing health data and its application in clinical decision-making. In response, a new master's program in personalized medicine has been launched across five universities in Denmark. This study, drawing on the sociology of expertise, investigates how educators and master's students in the program perceive and engage with the knowledge necessary for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into patient treatment and care. Our findings suggest a prevailing belief among educators in the potential of AI and big data to revolutionize healthcare by personalizing treatment options and improving diagnostic processes. Course participants generally acknowledged the ethical responsibility to leverage the vast amounts of data provided by patients to enhance treatment outcomes. However, some feared it might undermine the clinical insight they had gained through years of experience - insights they described as 'the art of medicine.' They navigated their agency and autonomy in the human-algorithm collaboration by framing algorithms as supportive additions to human judgment rather than replacements for it. In conclusion, this paper advocates for a more integrated approach that combines big data analysis with practical experience in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension (HTN) impacts approximately 1.28 billion individuals globally and poses a great burden of disease. The objectives of this study are to explore the role of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and artificial intelligence (AI) in the management of HTN. A thorough literature search was conducted across various databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science (WoS), and Medline to retrieve articles related to the role of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and AI in the precision medicine of HTN. Genes-including ACE, NOS3, ADD1, CYP11B2, NPPA, and NPPB-have a profound impact on blood pressure (BP) regulation in our body and polymorphism in these key genes can lead to HTN. Up or down-regulation of genes by epigenetic factors such as miRNA-155, miRNA-210, and miRNA-122 can significantly contribute to the development of HTN. These genetic and epigenetic factors can also be used as specific targets for gene editing and gene therapy for long-term management of HTN. However, the implementation of these techniques has not been possible in clinical settings due to lack of human studies and safety concerns related to unpredictable DNA alterations, nucleotide deletions, and loss of allele-specific chromosomes. Modulation of gut microbiome through oral supplements, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), and dietary interventions has emerged as one the most effective and safe techniques for managing HTN in human models. AI-based cutting-edge models have helped curate personalized diet plans based on an individual's unique microbiome, genomic information, and physiological conditions leading to a reduction in BMI, fat, BP, and heart rate while improving overall cardiac health and gut microbial diversity. Despite the significant advantages offered by AI-based medicine, ethical concerns-related to data privacy, bias, and discrimination-and ineffective models have led to limited integration of AI in precision medicine of HTN. The integration of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and AI-based models can play a key role in improving the current landscape of precision medicine of HTN. These cutting-edge techniques can lead to a shift from the current one-size-fits all approach to more personalized treatment plan however further research in human models is needed to determine the safety and true efficacy of these techniques. Additionally, new AI-models need to be developed that address ethical concerns and are effective in real-world clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are revolutionizing brain cancer theranostics by enhancing drug delivery and diagnostic accuracy. This review examines AI-enhanced engineering strategies for developing intelligent nanocarriers that target glioblastoma and other metastatic central nervous system malignancies. AI encompasses several computational methods, including machine learning (ML) and its subset deep learning (DL). Here, ML algorithms learn design rules for nanocarriers, and DL networks intricate pattern recognition for tumor segmentation and adaptive release. These approaches enable stimuli-responsive nanocarriers to react to tumor microenvironmental signals (eg, pH, enzyme activity) and external stimuli (eg, ultrasound), optimizing targeted medication release while minimizing off-target effects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), in conjunction with AI, enhance tumor detection and segmentation, while the integration of multiomics data facilitates tailored treatment planning. Advanced technologies encompass transferrin-functionalized nanoparticles for traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and dual-stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems. Notwithstanding general progress, apprehensions surrounding batch variability and industrial scalability persist. This review also addresses ethical concerns and cost disparities associated with AI-based therapeutics. The primary development target areas are federated learning for data privacy, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for regulatory transparency, and quantum ML for molecular-scale optimization. This paper charts the course to patient-specific, scalable neuro-oncology nanomedicine through the convergence of computational modeling, intelligent materials, and advanced imaging modalities. These themes are explored in greater detail in the introduction, where we lay the groundwork for intelligent nanocarriers, their design with the help of AI, and the clinical need for diagnostics-therapeutics convergence in brain cancer.",

These challenges are profoundly interconnected and have the potential to exacerbate global inequalities, jeopardize health security, and undermine the progress achieved through decades of international collaboration. Our viewpoint declaration, developed by 366 healthcare workers and scientists from 119 countries across six continents, highlights the urgent need for global solidarity and collective action to address these interconnected global health challenges. As healthcare workers and scientists, we must prioritize the protection of scientific integrity, combat political interference, and restore public trust in the scientific process. This will require a commitment to transparency, ethical responsibility, and evidence-based decision-making that can stand strong in the face of political and social adversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of resilient healthcare systems, emphasizing that preparedness, capacity building and coherent leadership and coordination are essential for future global health crises. In addition, our call for a One Health approach, acknowledging the intricate relationship between human, animal, and environmental health, has never been more pressing, especially as zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance spread across borders. As we confront ongoing wars, environmental destruction, and global persistent health inequalities, it is only through unity, solidarity, collaboration, and innovation that we hope to build a healthier, more equitable world. Together, we must ensure that science and medicine remain a force for good, capable of addressing both the immediate and long-term needs and challenges facing our shared future.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the accuracy and reliability of six large language models (LLMs)-three Chinese (Doubao, Kimi, DeepSeek) and three international (ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro, Grok3)-in radiology, using simulated questions from the 2025 Chinese Radiology Attending Physician Qualification Examination (CRAPQE). Analysis covered 400 CRAPQE-simulated questions, spanning various formats (A1, A2-A4, B, C-type) and modalities (text-only, image-based). Expert radiologists scored responses against official answer keys. Performance comparisons within and between Chinese and international LLM groups assessed overall, unit-specific, question-type-specific, and modality-specific accuracy. All LLMs passed the CRAPQE simulation, showing proficiency comparable to a radiology attending. Chinese LLMs achieved a higher mean accuracy (87.2%) than international LLMs (80.4%, P < 0.05), excelling in text-only and A1-type questions (P < 0.05). DeepSeek (91.6%) and Doubao (89.5%) outperformed Kimi (80.5%, P < 0.0167), while international LLMs showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). All models surpassed the passing threshold on image-based questions but performed worse than on text questions, with no group difference (P > 0.05). This pioneering comparison highlights the potential of LLMs in radiology, with Chinese models outperforming their international counterparts, likely due to localized training, providing evidence to guide the development of medical AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping medical diagnostics, and nephrology - characterized by multifactorial disease patterns - stands to benefit markedly. Machine‑learning and deep‑learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and large language models (LLMs), can analyze heterogeneous data streams from electronic health records, imaging, histopathology and genomics to support diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic planning. AI‑driven automation of routine workflows (e.g., appointment scheduling, NLP‑based documentation, chatbot‑guided anamneses) enables clinicians to focus on complex decision‑making, while real‑time decision‑support tools can integrate laboratory, imaging and guideline data. Recent advances include CNN‑based detection of renal lesions, deep‑learning prognostic scores for IgA nephropathy, and AI‑enhanced variant calling (e.g., DeepVariant). Nevertheless, challenges persist: data bias, limited external validation, \"hallucinations\" of LLMs, regulatory compliance (MDR, GDPR), and the need for transparent, locally hosted models. Successful implementation requires interoperable, FHIR‑compatible data, robust training of staff, and integration of AI education into medical education. With this, AI promises substantial efficiency gains, improved diagnostic precision, and sustained care quality in nephrology.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical workflows is advancing even before full compliance with the European Union Cross-Border eHealth Network (MyHealth@EU) framework is achieved. While AI-based clinical decision support systems are automatically classified as high risk under the European Union's AI Act, cross-border health data exchange must also satisfy MyHealth@EU interoperability requirements. This creates a dual-compliance challenge: vertical safety and ethics controls mandated by the AI Act and horizontal semantic transport requirements enforced through Open National Contact Point (OpenNCP) gateways, many of which are still maturing toward production readiness. This paper provides a practical, phase-oriented tutorial that enables developers and providers to embed AI Act safeguards before approaching MyHealth@EU interoperability tests. The goal is to show how AI-specific metadata can be included in the Health Level Seven International Clinical Document Architecture and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources messages without disrupting standard structures, ensuring both compliance and trustworthiness in AI-assisted clinical decisions. We systematically analyzed Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (AI Act) and the OpenNCP technical specifications, extracting a harmonized set of overlapping obligations. The AI Act provisions on transparency, provenance, and robustness are mapped directly onto MyHealth@EU workflows, identifying the points where outgoing messages must record AI involvement, log provenance, and trigger validation. To operationalize this mapping, we propose a minimal extension set, covering AI contribution status, rationale, risk classification, and Annex IV documentation links, together with a phase-based compliance checklist that aligns AI Act controls with MyHealth@EU conformance steps. A simulated International Patient Summary transmission demonstrates how Clinical Document Architecture/Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources extensions can annotate AI involvement, how OpenNCP processes such enriched payloads, and how clinicians in another member state view the result with backward compatibility preserved. We expand on security considerations (eg, Open Worldwide Application Security Project generative AI risks such as prompt injection and adversarial inputs), continuous postmarket risk assessment, monitoring, and alignment with MyHealth@EU's incident aggregation system. Limitations reflect the immaturity of current infrastructures and regulations, with real-world validation pending the rollout of key dependencies. AI-enabled clinical software succeeds only when AI Act safeguards and MyHealth@EU interoperability rules are engineered together from day 0. This tutorial provides developers with a forward-looking blueprint that reduces duplication of effort, streamlines conformance testing, and embeds compliance early. While the concept is still in its early phases of practice, it represents a necessary and worthwhile direction for ensuring that future AI-enabled clinical systems can meet both European Union regulatory requirements from day 1., risks such as prompt injection and adversarial inputs), continuous postmarket risk assessment, monitoring, and alignment with MyHealth@EU's incident aggregation system. Limitations reflect the immaturity of current infrastructures and regulations, with real-world validation pending the rollout of key dependencies.",

    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining attention in rheumatology, little is known about patient perspectives. This study addresses this gap by examining patients' experiences and attitudes toward AI. A nationwide, cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between March and May 2025 among adult patients with rheumatic diseases in Germany. Data were analyzed descriptively and with cluster analysis. A total of 778 patients completed the survey (70.4% female, mean age 51.3 years). The most common diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis (31.7%). While 26.8% reported current AI use for health-related purposes, 57.8% expressed interest in using it. Patients were particularly interested in AI-based symptom checkers (64.3%), therapy recommendations (50.6%), and chatbots for medical inquiries (44.5%). 57.6% of patients indicated that they would welcome their rheumatologists using AI-based clinical suppport. The most frequently cited benefits of AI included improved information access (63.5%) and faster diagnosis (57.7%), while concerns centered on faulty AI (74.3%) and reduced human interaction (59.6%). Cluster analysis identified three distinct patient profiles: 'AI-savvy' (41.4%), 'AI-pragmatic' (44.8%), and 'AI-skeptical' (13.8%). Cluster membership was significantly associated with age and education, with younger patients more often belonging to the 'AI-savvy' group. Patients with rheumatic diseases showed substantial interest in AI-supported care, although actual use in medical contexts remained limited. Age and education differences highlight the need for tailored implementation strategies to ensure equitable and patient-centered adoption of AI in rheumatology.",

While phytoremediation offers a sustainable alternative to conventional remediation methods, its efficiency remains limited. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and multiomics technologies (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) provide transformative opportunities to overcome these limitations. This review highlights the integration of AI-driven models with multiomics data to optimize phytoremediation strategies. AI enables the prediction of plant-microbe interactions, selection of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), and modeling of metal transporter dynamics, thereby enhancing crop tolerance and metal accumulation. By mining large-scale omics datasets, AI can also identify critical pathways for detoxification and guide precision engineering of plants and microbes. The convergence of AI, ML, and multi-omics technologies represents a transformative approach to solving the challenge of heavy metal pollution in soils. This integrated framework not only accelerates the development of metal-resistant crops but also paves the way for a new era of precision remediation, where tailored, data-driven solutions could revolutionize soil decontamination and lead to more sustainable and resilient agricultural practices.",

    "abstract": "Future research on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins is essential for advancing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and control amid rising drug resistance and global health challenges. Recent studies focus on elucidating protein structures and interactions critical to bacterial survival, virulence, and drug resistance, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Cutting-edge technologies such as single-cell proteomics, cryo-electron microscopy, and spatial proteomics provide unprecedented resolution of protein localization, dynamics, and host-pathogen interactions. Posttranslational modifications and dynamic proteomic profiling reveal bacterial adaptive mechanisms, while integrative multi-omics combined with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning accelerate functional annotation and predictive modeling. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-based functional genomics complements these approaches by enabling precise gene regulation studies. Advances in AI-powered diagnostics and genomic surveillance are transforming TB detection and drug resistance profiling, improving patient outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Overall, integrating experimental and computational innovations promises to deepen understanding of Mtb biology, accelerate drug discovery, enhance diagnostics, and ultimately contribute to global efforts in combating tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies and multi-omics approaches has led to rapid accumulation of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and even single-cell multimodal datasets, resulting in an exponential growth of biological data. The massive scale and inherent complexity of these datasets pose significant challenges for data management, analysis, and interpretation in the field of bioinformatics. Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning, have achieved groundbreaking advances in medical diagnostics, drug discovery, and genomic analyses, providing novel theoretical tools and analytical paradigms for bioinformatics research. AI techniques are now extensively applied to DNA, RNA, and protein sequence prediction and design, 3D structural elucidation, functional annotation, integrative analysis of multi-omics data, and personalized drug design for precision medicine, significantly advancing biological research. This review systematically summarizes recent research progress and representative applications of AI techniques in bioinformatics, specifically discussing suitable scenarios and advantages of traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and reinforcement learning methods. We highlight AI's transformative impact with quantitative metrics from landmark achievements: accurate near-atomic protein structure prediction (median 0.96 Å on CASP14), robust single-cell modeling (AvgBIO $\\approx $ 0.82), high protein design success rates (up to 92%), and sensitive cancer detection (Area Under Curve (AUC) $\\approx $ 0.93). Furthermore, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of the latest advancements of AI in specific tasks, including biomedical text mining, multimodal omics integration, and single-cell analyses, while highlighting current challenges such as data noise and sparsity, difficulties in modeling long biological sequences, complexities in multimodal data integration, insufficient model interpretability, and ethical and privacy concerns. Finally, the paper outlines promising future research directions, emphasizing large-scale data mining, cross-domain model generalization, innovations in drug design and personalized medicine, and advocates for establishing an open and collaborative research ecosystem.",

Customer Data Platforms (CDPs), originally created in marketing to unify diverse information into dynamic individual profiles, could provide a new approach for person-centered public health. This article explores the strategic potential of applying CDP principles, such as data unification, identity resolution, segmentation, and timely intervention, to enhance surveillance, prevention, and chronic disease management. A conceptual framework is presented and demonstrated through a breast cancer screening scenario, illustrating how CDPs could enable personalized outreach and integration with artificial intelligence (AI). Although promising, there are significant challenges related to privacy, interoperability, fairness, and governance.

    "abstract": "Physicians face a significant documentation burden, spending twice as much time on electronic health records (EHRs) as on direct patient care. Consultation summary reports from the emergency department (ED) are critical for continuity of care and clinical decision-making. This study aims to evaluate the quality and utility of automatically generated neurological consultation reports with clear recommendations, while reducing neurologists' documentation burden. We used neurological consultation reports (n = 250) from the ED as reference outputs. For each case, we fed the report's constituent components into the large language model (LLM). Using prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate auto-summarized reports, which were then compared against the original consultation reports. The Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and semantic embedding (Clinical-BioBert) were used as performance metrics. The LLM-generated report exhibited high semantic similarity with the neurologist's report (0.89 ± 0.03). However, significant differences in report length were observed, with LLM-generated reports being more concise than those written by attending neurologists (61.56 vs. 94.75 words, p < 0.001). Additionally, LLM-generated reports were written in a more straightforward and accessible style (FKGL = 11.3 vs. 12.22, p < 0.001). Despite these strengths, the LLM-generated reports exhibited substantial divergence in writing style from neurologists' reports (ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.25, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.09, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.19). LLM-generated neurological consultation reports demonstrate strong semantic alignment with human-authored reports while offering a more concise and accessible format. Notable differences in writing style suggest a standardized approach that, while effective in conveying clinical content, may lack the personalization of neurologist-written reports.",

    "abstract": "Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), represents a global health challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in the progression and therapeutic resistance of HCC. Interventional therapies have emerged as pivotal modalities in the treatment of liver cancer, especially in cases that are unsuitable for surgical resection. The evolution of these techniques has been markedly enhanced by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which has the potential to increase precision, improve outcomes, and personalize patient care. This review covers modern interventional therapies for liver cancer, highlighting recent advances in minimally invasive procedures. It describes the intricate liver TME and emphasizes the importance of characterizing its diversity and identifying therapeutic targets. Additionally, we discuss how AI can decipher TME complexities, predict responses, categorize patients, and personalize treatments. By elucidating connections between the TME, therapeutic interventions, and AI, this review aims to improve the management and care of patients with liver cancer.",

    "abstract": "Remote robotic surgery (RRS) represents a frontier in surgical innovation, integrating robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-speed communication networks. Despite its clinical significance, the global research landscape and conceptual evolution of RRS remain insufficiently mapped. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 857 Scopus-indexed documents (1980-2025) was conducted using Bibliometrix (R-package), VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. Analyses covered descriptive trends, country productivity, citation impact, collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence, Bradford's Law of journal concentration, CiteSpace co-citation clustering, and thematic evolution. Thematic mapping was performed using the Walktrap clustering algorithm (250 words, minimum cluster frequency = 5) to visualize conceptual structures and developmental trajectories. RRS research exhibited an annual growth rate of 10.35%, with strong international collaboration (26.96%). The United States, China, Japan, and France dominated global contributions. Keyword co-occurrence and CiteSpace clustering revealed five thematic domains-robotic systems, telemedicine integration, surgical innovation, AI-assisted imaging, and 5G-enabled connectivity. Bradford's Law identified a small core of specialized journals as primary publication outlets. Thematic evolution (1980-2025) indicated three conceptual eras: foundational simulation and telepresence (1980-2013), technological integration with 5G and AI (2014-2022), and intelligent convergence emphasizing deep learning, blockchain, and ultra-low-latency communication (2023-2025). Thematic mapping further highlighted telesurgery as a basic theme and surgery as a motor theme driving interdisciplinary expansion. This bibliometric synthesis reveals a paradigm shift from early teleoperation frameworks to AI-driven, 5G-powered, and cybersecure surgical ecosystems. Future research should prioritize real-time data fusion, robotic autonomy, and ethical frameworks guiding intelligent telesurgical networks.",

When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.",

Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.",

    "abstract": "Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.",

    "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of designing effective reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant bottleneck, often requiring extensive human expertise and being time-consuming. Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.",

    "abstract": "Information-seeking is a core capability for AI agents, requiring them to gather and reason over tool-generated information across long trajectories. However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.",

    "abstract": "Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

    "abstract": "Novel deep learning architectures are increasingly being applied to biological data, including genetic sequences. These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.",

    "abstract": "The black box nature of deep neural networks poses a significant challenge for the deployment of transparent and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems. With the growing presence of AI in society, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods that can explain and interpret the decisions made by these systems. To address this, mechanistic interpretability (MI) emerged as a promising and distinctive research program within the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). MI is the process of studying the inner computations of neural networks and translating them into human-understandable algorithms. It encompasses reverse engineering techniques aimed at uncovering the computational algorithms implemented by neural networks. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy of MI approaches and provide a detailed analysis of key techniques, illustrated with concrete examples and pseudo-code. We contextualize MI within the broader interpretability landscape, comparing its goals, methods, and insights to other strands of XAI. Additionally, we trace the development of MI as a research area, highlighting its conceptual roots and the accelerating pace of recent work. We argue that MI holds significant potential to support a more scientific understanding of machine learning systems -- treating models not only as tools for solving tasks, but also as systems to be studied and understood. We hope to invite new researchers into the field of mechanistic interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.   To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline.

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.   This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.",

A practical alternative is to iteratively refine the neighborhood of an initial design using local optimization methods such as gradient descent. We propose local entropy search (LES), a Bayesian optimization paradigm that explicitly targets the solutions reachable by the descent sequences of iterative optimizers. The algorithm propagates the posterior belief over the objective through the optimizer, resulting in a probability distribution over descent sequences. It then selects the next evaluation by maximizing mutual information with that distribution, using a combination of analytic entropy calculations and Monte-Carlo sampling of descent sequences. Empirical results on high-complexity synthetic objectives and benchmark problems show that LES achieves strong sample efficiency compared to existing local and global Bayesian optimization methods.",

To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines.

This research introduces a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that learns aleatoric uncertainty directly through probabilistic modeling, an approach unexplored in existing CMAPSS-based literature. Our hierarchical architecture integrates multi-scale Inception blocks for temporal pattern extraction, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequential modeling, and a dual-level attention mechanism operating simultaneously on sensor and temporal dimensions. The innovation lies in the Bayesian output layer that predicts both mean RUL and variance, enabling the model to learn data-inherent uncertainty. Comprehensive preprocessing employs condition-aware clustering, wavelet denoising, and intelligent feature selection. Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks (FD001-FD004) demonstrates competitive overall performance with RMSE values of 16.22, 19.29, 16.84, and 19.98 respectively. Remarkably, our framework achieves breakthrough critical zone performance (RUL <= 30 cycles) with RMSE of 5.14, 6.89, 5.27, and 7.16, representing 25-40 percent improvements over conventional approaches and establishing new benchmarks for safety-critical predictions. The learned uncertainty provides well-calibrated 95 percent confidence intervals with coverage ranging from 93.5 percent to 95.2 percent, enabling risk-aware maintenance scheduling previously unattainable in CMAPSS literature.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an enormous amount of sensor data that requires transmission to cloud servers for processing, resulting in excessive network congestion, increased latency and high energy consumption. This is particularly problematic in resource-constrained and remote environments where bandwidth is limited, and battery-dependent devices further emphasize the problem. Moreover, in domains such as agriculture, consecutive sensor readings often have minimal variation, making continuous data transmission inefficient and unnecessarily resource intensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical prediction algorithm designed for edge computing environments and validated through simulation. The proposed solution utilizes a predictive filter at the network edge that forecasts the next sensor data point and triggers data transmission only when the deviation from the predicted value exceeds a predefined tolerance. A complementary cloud-based model ensures data integrity and overall system consistency. This dual-model strategy effectively reduces communication overhead and demonstrates potential for improving energy efficiency by minimizing redundant transmissions. In addition to reducing communication load, our approach leverages both in situ and satellite observations from the same locations to enhance model robustness. It also supports cross-site generalization, enabling models trained in one region to be effectively deployed elsewhere without retraining. This makes our solution highly scalable, energy-aware, and well-suited for optimizing sensor data transmission in remote and bandwidth-constrained IoT environments.",

Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network.",

Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics.",

    "abstract": "In Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL), the central server immediately updates the global model with each arriving client's contribution. As a result, clients perform their local training on different model versions, causing information staleness (delay). In federated environments with non-IID local data distributions, this asynchronous pattern amplifies the adverse effect of client heterogeneity (due to different data distribution, local objectives, etc.), as faster clients contribute more frequent updates, biasing the global model. We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients. We also introduce a delay-aware variant, ACED, to balance client diversity against update staleness. Experiments on different models for different tasks across diverse heterogeneity and delay settings validate our analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of our approaches.",

    "abstract": "MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.",

    "abstract": "Preference learning has recently emerged as a pivotal strategy for post-training alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data.",

For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM.

While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.",

Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.",

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation. A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.",

    "abstract": "Group-based policy optimization methods like GRPO and GSPO have become standard for training multimodal models, leveraging group-wise rollouts and relative advantage estimation. However, they suffer from a critical \\emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{VADE}, a \\textbf{V}ariance-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \\textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead. More importantly, our framework can serves as a plug-and-play component to be seamlessly integrated into existing group-based RL algorithms.

    "abstract": "Efficient deployment of small language models (SLMs) is essential for numerous real-world applications with stringent latency constraints. While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.",

While recent advances in LLM-based code generation show promise for complex optimization, existing methods struggle with the vast optimization space due to insufficient hardware domain knowledge, failing to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates.

While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate WaveTuner achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in time series forecasting.",

Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions.   To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization.   Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost.",

There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.   Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.",

A single neural network parameterizes both the velocity and pressure fields, and is trained by minimizing the residual of a Poisson's equation for pressure, constrained by the momentum and continuity equations, together with boundary conditions on the velocity field. No boundary conditions are imposed on the pressure field aside from anchoring the pressure at a point to prevent its unbounded development. The training is performed from scratch without labeled data, relying solely on the governing equations and constraints. To enhance accuracy in advection-dominated flows, we employ a single Fourier feature mapping of the input coordinates. The proposed method is demonstrated for the canonical lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 7,500 and for laminar flow over a circular cylinder with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, achieving excellent agreement with benchmark solutions. We further compare the present formulation against alternative objective-function constructions based on different arrangements of the flow equations, thereby highlighting the algorithmic advantages of the proposed formulation centered around the Poisson's equation for pressure.",

    "abstract": "Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.",

Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class. As a result, the method is essentially model-free and holds significant promise for theoretically evaluating modern opaque machine learning system--such as deep nerral networks and generative model--where traditional capacity-based learning theory becomes infeasible due to the extreme complexity of the hypothesis class.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.",

This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection.",

Despite these advancements, the absence of open-source, standardized benchmarks has led to inconsistent data usage and evaluation methods.

(2) A high-reliability satellite and in-situ observations for model evaluation, covering approximately 100 million locations in the global ocean.

To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed \"consistent\" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design, implementation, and evolution of a comprehensive multimodal room-monitoring system that integrates synchronized video and audio processing for real-time activity recognition and anomaly detection. We describe two iterations of the system: an initial lightweight implementation using YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and an advanced version that incorporates multi-model audio ensembles, hybrid object detection, bidirectional cross-modal attention, and multi-method anomaly detection. The evolution demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and industrial applicability. The advanced system combines three audio models (AST, Wav2Vec2, and HuBERT) for comprehensive audio understanding, dual object detectors (YOLO and DETR) for improved accuracy, and sophisticated fusion mechanisms for enhanced cross-modal learning. Experimental evaluation shows the system's effectiveness in general monitoring scenarios as well as specialized industrial safety applications, achieving real-time performance on standard hardware while maintaining high accuracy.",

However, conventional sparsification remains model-centric, selecting neurons solely by activation magnitude and neglecting how access patterns influence flash performance. We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency. By aligning sparsification decisions with the underlying storage behavior, Neuron Chunking improves I/O efficiency by up to 4.65x and 5.76x on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise. Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These \"one-shot\" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.   We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.   We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than naïve search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.",

    "abstract": "The KV cache is a dominant memory bottleneck for LLM inference. While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget. We release the full implementation of Kitty at https://github.com/Summer-Summer/Kitty.",

    "abstract": "Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models increasingly function as representational systems, yet the philosoph- ical assumptions underlying their internal structures remain largely unexamined. This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Sampling multiple outputs from a Large Language Model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent (Self-consistency) or highest-scoring (Best-of-N) candidate is a popular approach to achieve higher accuracy in tasks with discrete final answers. Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms.",

This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation.

Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and Gödelian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities. We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outline principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require, and furthermore, a conceptual method of structuralizing the richer framework on which the principle of neural network system takes hold.",

    "abstract": "Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \\textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of \"\\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}\" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \\textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \\textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent pre-training strategies for molecular graphs have attempted to use 2D and 3D molecular views as both inputs and self-supervised signals, primarily aligning graph-level representations. However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) flare-ups pose a significant health risk for older adults with chronic conditions. These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches relying on simple binary classification for UTI detection offer limited utility to nurses and practitioners as they lack insight into prediction uncertainty, hindering informed clinical decision-making. This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions (\"I don't know\") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width. A survey of 42 nurses confirms that our system's outputs are valuable for guiding clinical decision-making, underscoring their practical utility in improving informed decisions and effectively managing UTIs and other condition flare-ups in older adults.",

A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer a promising path toward scalable and efficient large vision-language systems. However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%. These results demonstrate that fine-grained, importance-driven expert allocation significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal MoE models.",

    "abstract": "Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring that the right resource is available at the right location and time remains a major challenge for organizations operating large-scale logistics networks. The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$κ$ resources for each arc in the network.

    "abstract": "The convergence of Agentic AI and MAS enables a new paradigm for intelligent decision making in SMS. Traditional MAS architectures emphasize distributed coordination and specialized autonomy, while recent advances in agentic AI driven by LLMs introduce higher order reasoning, planning, and tool orchestration capabilities. This paper presents a hybrid agentic AI and multi agent framework for a Prescriptive Maintenance use case, where LLM based agents provide strategic orchestration and adaptive reasoning, complemented by rule based and SLMs agents performing efficient, domain specific tasks on the edge. The proposed framework adopts a layered architecture that consists of perception, preprocessing, analytics, and optimization layers, coordinated through an LLM Planner Agent that manages workflow decisions and context retention. Specialized agents autonomously handle schema discovery, intelligent feature analysis, model selection, and prescriptive optimization, while a HITL interface ensures transparency and auditability of generated maintenance recommendations. This hybrid design supports dynamic model adaptation, cost efficient maintenance scheduling, and interpretable decision making. An initial proof of concept implementation is validated on two industrial manufacturing datasets. The developed framework is modular and extensible, supporting seamless integration of new agents or domain modules as capabilities evolve. The results demonstrate the system capability to automatically detect schema, adapt preprocessing pipelines, optimize model performance through adaptive intelligence, and generate actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations. The framework shows promise in achieving improved robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, bridging the gap between high level agentic reasoning and low level autonomous execution.",

Building on single-objective, single-agent algorithms, we instantiate this framework with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), yielding MOMA-TD3 and MOMA-DDPG. The framework combines a multi-headed actor network, a centralised critic, and an objective preference-conditioning architecture, enabling a single neural network to encode the Pareto front of optimal trade-off policies for all agents across conflicting objectives in a continuous MOMARL setting. We also outline a natural test suite for continuous MOMARL by combining a pre-existing multi-agent single-objective physics simulator with its multi-objective single-agent counterpart. Evaluating cooperative locomotion tasks in this suite, we show that our framework achieves statistically significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume relative to outer-loop and independent training baselines, while demonstrating stable scalability as the number of agents increases. These results establish our framework as a foundational step towards robust, scalable multi-objective policy learning in continuous multi-agent domains.",

    "abstract": "Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is a crucial component of particle physics experiments and ensures that the recorded data is of the highest quality, and suitable for subsequent physics analysis. Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework. The encouraging results underline the potential of simulation-driven studies as a foundation for developing more advanced, data-driven DQM systems for future particle detectors.",

We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution \"context stream\" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity \"insight stream\" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\\textbf{S}$ubspace $\\textbf{P}$rojection $\\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.",

First,a microgrid system integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS), along with its Markov decision process (MDP), is modelled. Second, a predictive control approach based on a deep Q network (DQN) is presented, in which a weighted average algorithm and a new ETD algorithm are designed to quantify and address the prediction uncertainty, respectively.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet aligning them with the multifaceted reasoning pathways of real-world medicine remains a major challenge. Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.",

Our model operates in a highly volatile market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., lambda = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfolio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already enable robust optimization.

Previously, we showed that removing these \"artifacts\" eliminates 70% of predictive correlation, suggesting body signals functionally drive cognition. Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition.   Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p<0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs.   Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics.   Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration. This architecture may fundamentally distinguish biological from artificial intelligence.

This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance. DeepSeek excels in data type correctness and status code detection, while GPT-4o performs best in API operation coverage. For both models, LLM generated test scripts maintained 100\\% syntax correctness and only required minimal manual edits for semantic correctness. These findings indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of MASTEST.",

Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \\emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization.

    "abstract": "User retention is a critical objective for online platforms like Pinterest, as it strengthens user loyalty and drives growth through repeated engagement. A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.",

    "abstract": "We present ContagionRL, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning platform specifically designed for systematic reward engineering in spatial epidemic simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.",

    "abstract": "Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for editing pre-trained models face significant challenges, primarily high computational costs and limited scalability. Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising solution, using simple arithmetic operations-addition and negation-based on task vectors which are the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights, to efficiently modify model behavior. However, the full potential of task arithmetic remains underexplored, primarily due to limited mechanisms for overcoming optimization stagnation. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of difference vector, a generalized form of task vectors derived from the historical movements during optimization. Using difference vectors as directed perturbations, we propose the Difference Vector-based Anisotropic Scaling Iterative algorithm (DV-BASI) to enable a continuous optimization process for task arithmetic methods without relying on any additional modules or components. Notably, by leveraging escapability and directional advantages of difference vectors, the average performance on different tasks of the multi-task model merged by DV-BASI may even outperform models individually fine-tuned. Based on this observation, we extend the application of difference vectors to a feasible fine-tuning method for single-task models. On the practical side, DV-BASI allows expressive searching directions with few learnable parameters and forms a scalable framework. We also integrate DV-BASI with task arithmetic methods and advanced optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both supervised and unsupervised evaluation protocols.",

The framework's performance is benchmarked against equal-weighted, index-based, and single-model approaches (LSTM-only and PPO-only) using annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics, each adjusted for transaction costs.

    "abstract": "As AI agents attempt to autonomously act on users' behalf, they raise transparency and control issues. We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent agents equipped with causal knowledge can optimize their action spaces to avoid unnecessary exploration. The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions -- observational or experimental -- and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning.",
