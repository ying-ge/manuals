    "abstract": "The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has reshaped drug discovery. AI-based models typically rely on molecular representations for prediction. However, the absence of physically grounded information in mainstream molecular representations not only limits the model performance in practical applications, but also hinders the mechanistic understanding and exploitation by human. To overcome this issue, we introduce qcGEM, a quantum-chemistry-aware graph-based embedding of molecules that incorporates physical priors into molecular representation learning. By integrating quantum chemistry knowledge with a physics-inspired architecture, qcGEM provides a compact, physics-informed molecular representation that supports a diverse range of downstream applications. Particularly, qcGEM demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of molecule-related benchmarks, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations on 71 tasks including molecular property prediction, activity cliff detection, protein-ligand interaction modeling and opioid drug classification, and simultaneously offers strong interpretability at multiple representation levels. We additionally propose a simplified variant, qcGEM-Hybrid, with substantially accelerated embedding generation and robust performance. Overall, our method provides an advanced molecular representation that will benefit molecule-related modeling and prediction, supporting further progress in AI-aided drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Risk stratification remains a critical challenge in non-small cell lung cancer patients for optimal therapy selection. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-powered spatial cellomics approach that combines histology, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging and multimodal machine learning to characterize the complex cellular relationships of 43 cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment in a real-world retrospective cohort of 1168 non-small cell lung cancer patients from two large German cancer centers. The model identifies cell niches associated with survival and achieves a 14% and 47% improvement in risk stratification in the two main non-small cell lung cancer subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, combining niche patterns with conventional cancer staging. Our results show that complex immune cell niche patterns identify potentially undertreated high-risk patients qualifying for adjuvant therapy. Our approach highlights the potential of artificial intelligence powered multiplex imaging analyses to better understand the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to cancer progression and to improve risk stratification and treatment selection in non-small cell lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "The PIRP Project (Progressive Renal Insufficiency Prevention), launched in Emilia-Romagna in the early 2000s, was created to establish a network between general practitioners and nephrologists aimed at the early identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD), slowing its progression, and improving clinical outcomes. The project included several phases: a training phase for general practitioners, the establishment of dedicated outpatient clinics, and the creation of a regional electronic registry, which today includes more than 38,000 patients. The results have shown a reduction in CKD progression, fewer urgent dialysis starts, and better control of comorbidities. PIRP differs from the national PDTA for CKD in its operational and regional approach, based on real-world data and multidisciplinary co-management, whereas the PDTA represents a general regulatory framework. The project has developed predictive models (such as CT-PIRP), inspired comparative European studies, and today stands as a model of integrated healthcare, useful for the implementation of nephroprotective drugs and artificial intelligence. Twenty years after its inception, PIRP remains an example of proactive and collaborative medicine, anticipating modern paradigms of population health management.",

    "abstract": "The promising integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) or AI chatbots, into medical education and practice necessitates rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. While chatbot performance has been assessed against standardized exams like the bar, medical and dental boards, and in diagnostic specialties such as radiology and ophthalmology, a critical gap exists within the complex discipline of pathology, specifically concerning subspecialty areas like head and neck pathology. Conducting a pilot study evaluating chatbot responses to head and neck pathology board-style questions is therefore essential and novel. Crucially for education, this pilot study evaluated six AI chatbots on their performance in answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) retrieved from authorities in the field of head and neck pathology. Twenty MCQs relevant to head and neck pathology were identified from the public domain. A total of 120 responses from six chatbots were evaluated for response and citation accuracy. Although AI chatbots answered head and neck pathology board-style questions with 85-100% accuracy, citation accuracy and performance on image-based questions were poor. Considering the pedagogical principle that actively challenging exam questions enhances memory retention and learning outcomes compared to passive text review, AI-generated multiple-choice questions specifically designed for head and neck pathology study revision purposes were generated. The generated MCQs were determined to be at a more fundamental level and suitable for predoctoral dental students or first-year pathology residents. This pilot study probed the limitations of these tools in accurately addressing diagnostic and interpretive challenges. Furthermore, the recommendations and guidelines informed from the results of this pilot study represent a vital first step in the addressing the responsible use of AI for head and neck pathology education and practice.",

In terms of publication volume, China, the United States, and the England ranked at the forefront, while Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences emerged as central contributors in this field. Keyword co-occurrence and burst analysis indicated a transition in research emphasis-from an initial stage centered on \"force feedback\" and \"master-slave control\" to a more sophisticated paradigm integrating \"artificial intelligence\", \"cloud computing\" and \"5G communication\". Simultaneously, technical challenges have evolved beyond latency optimization to include pressing issues such as cybersecurity, ethical governance, medical insurance reimbursement, and multimodal sensory integration. This study presents, for the first time, a three-stage model characterizing the knowledge evolution of RAOTS and proposes a structured framework mapping its technological development path, thereby providing empirical evidence to support future standardization, clinical translation, and interdisciplinary cooperation.",

    "abstract": "Radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer demands meticulous pre-operative staging and real-time intra-operative guidance to optimise oncologic margins and minimize complications. Recent advances in artificial-intelligence algorithms reliably integrate multimodal clinical, imaging and pathological data, producing highly reproducible tumour-staging and risk-stratification models that inform personalised operative strategies. Concurrently, navigation platforms that fuse computed-tomography, magnetic-resonance, ultrasound and fluorescence datasets generate patient-specific three-dimensional reconstructions with sub-millimeter registration accuracy, enabling dynamic margin delineation and reducing inadvertent tissue injury. Predictive analytics that assimilate intra-operative metrics with early postoperative information can forecast survival and complication profiles, thereby supporting tailored follow-up protocols. Remaining barriers include safeguarding data privacy, accelerating image-registration and inference speeds, meeting high computational-resource demands and offsetting the substantial capital and maintenance costs of these systems. Nevertheless, the convergent evolution of artificial intelligence and real-time imaging navigation is poised to transform radical gastrectomy by elevating surgical precision, enhancing patient safety and improving long-term outcomes; realizing this promise will require algorithmic refinement, multicenter validation, robust ethical frameworks and cost-effective implementation models.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatitis poses persistent diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation, variable disease course, and lack of targeted interventions. Conventional tools, such as serum enzymes, cross-sectional imaging and clinical scoring systems, often exhibit limited sensitivity and prognostic value, especially during early or atypical stages. Moreover, therapeutic development remains slow, with limited progress toward personalized or mechanism-based strategies. These limitations highlight a critical need for integrative data-driven approaches. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance clinical decision-making in pancreatitis. This narrative review synthesizes recent progress in AI applications across three domains. First, AI-enabled diagnostic platforms incorporating radiomics, deep learning-based imaging analysis, and biomarker optimization have improved early detection and differentiation of pancreatic diseases. Second, AI-driven prognostic models now allow real-time severity prediction, complication forecasting, and recurrence risk assessment, some of which have been deployed in hospital information systems for intensive care units and mortality risk triage. Third, AI-assisted drug discovery and network pharmacology, particularly in combination with traditional Chinese medicine, have revealed novel therapeutic opportunities. Despite encouraging developments, challenges remain in data standardization, model transparency and clinical validation. A multidisciplinary strategy integrating omics data, longitudinal monitoring and pharmacological modeling may help bridge current gaps and advance precision medicine in pancreatitis care.",

In clinical practice AI consists of overlapping technologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and generative AI. ML is a computer learning system that can provide insight into disease risk factors and phenotypes. Deep learning is an advanced and complex form of ML, structured with different levels of specific algorithms known as convolutional neural networks that can rapidly and accurately process unstructured, high-dimensional data, such as texts, images, and waveforms. Natural language processing is dedicated to facilitating interactions between computers and humans using natural language and helps to analyze, understand, and derive actionable information from unstructured healthcare data, including electronic health records, clinical notes, medical literature, and patient-generated content. Computer vision focuses on enabling computers to see and interpret images and videos and serves as an augmentation tool for endoscopists, improving accuracy and decreasing procedural time. Generative AI is capable of creating new forms of content by learning from a large body of data in the form of text, audio, images, or video and includes large language models.

Mucosal and histological healing have emerged as key therapeutic targets, offering better long-term outcomes compared with previous targets. However, accurate disease assessment remains challenging because of interobserver variability and inconsistencies between endoscopic and histological findings. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming IBD care by enhancing the precision and reproducibility of disease evaluation. This review provided a structured synthesis of AI applications in IBD, organized by diagnostic, histological, and therapeutic domains, and highlighted comparative model performance such as machine learning classifiers (random forest, support vector machine) and deep learning models (convolutional and recurrent neural networks) with reported accuracy between 80% and 97% and areas under the curve ranging from 0.74 to 0.99. Beyond summarizing existing tools, the review emphasized the ability of AI to reduce diagnostic variability, improve early prediction of therapeutic response, and streamline clinical workflows. These advancements support a shift toward personalized treatment strategies and more efficient care delivery. Additionally, we outlined the expanding role of AI in clinical trials in which it supports patient stratification, endpoint prediction, and automated data integration.",

    "abstract": "Hepatology encompasses various aspects, such as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, liver failure, liver tumors, and liver transplantation. The global epidemiological situation of liver diseases is grave, posing a substantial threat to human health and quality of life. Characterized by high incidence and mortality rates, liver diseases have emerged as a prominent global public health concern. In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and radiomics has transformed medical research and clinical practice, demonstrating considerable potential in hepatology. AI is capable of automatically detecting abnormal cells in liver tissue sections, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of pathological diagnosis. Deep learning models are able to extract features from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging images to facilitate liver disease classification. Machine learning models are capable of integrating clinical data to forecast disease progression and treatment responses, thus supporting clinical decision-making for personalized medicine. Through the analysis of imaging data, laboratory results, and genomic information, AI can assist in diagnosis, forecast disease progression, and optimize treatment plans, thereby improving clinical outcomes for liver disease patients. This minireview intends to comprehensively summarize the state-of-the-art theories and applications of AI in hepatology, explore the opportunities and challenges it presents in clinical practice, basic research, and translational medicine, and propose future research directions to guide the advancement of hepatology and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",

The World Intellectual Property Organization Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge mandates patent disclosure requirements for genetic resources and traditional knowledge. While a step forward, the treaty's success depends on its effective implementation, ethical documentation of traditional knowledge, governance of artificial intelligence and equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms, among other factors. We examine traditional knowledge protection under intellectual property systems, the provisions of the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty, challenges to documentation of traditional knowledge and the role of artificial intelligence in the governance of traditional knowledge.

    "abstract": "The aspirations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) precision medicine and precision brain health are not fully realized despite significant advances in early pathological detection. Hampering progress is the difficult challenge of the accurate detection of behavioral symptoms that can help differentiate those at high risk specific to AD versus those with more AD and related dementias (ADRD), who may have AD along with other types of dementia, as well as those who will and will not progress to clinically expressed disease. Technological advances in hardware, software, and analytics are paving the way to opportunities to overcome these long-standing barriers to early clinical symptom detection, when recent and emerging interventions might be most effective. It is important to note that these innovations must not exist in isolation. Integration of data from both AD/ADRD related studies and non-AD related studies is needed whenever brain-related measures are collected to fully realize the scientific opportunities. We envision a near future of harmonized participant data sharing, encompassing standardized multimodal data alongside emerging digital streams, to deliver an invaluable resource for the global research community. HIGHLIGHTS: Technology is overcoming barriers to accurate early detection of behavioral symptoms of AD/ADRD.

    "abstract": "Bone fracture continues to pose a significant clinical challenge in regenerative medicine due to limited repair capacity and inadequate therapeutic options. Among the various therapeutic strategies, mesenchymal stem cells have shown strong potential due to their ability to promote bone formation, modulate inflammation, and migrate to injury sites. However, clinical outcomes have been limited by issues like low survival rates, poor integration, and non-specific distribution after transplantation. Functionalized mesenchymal cells enhanced through genetic, chemical, or material-based modifications have emerged as an advanced strategy to overcome these limitations and significantly improve bone regeneration. This review explores recent developments in the functionalization of stem cells to increase their bone-forming potential. It covers techniques of gene modification, preconditioning, nanoparticle integration, and scaffold-based delivery. The role of these engineered cells is in activating key pathways involved in bone repair, including bone morphogenetic proteins and Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the study highlights current delivery platforms, including injectable gels, printed scaffolds, and bioactive coatings that support targeted, sustained cell activity. Despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, unresolved challenges in manufacturing, immune compatibility, and regulatory pathways persist, prompting the exploration of emerging solutions like precision-engineered implants and artificial intelligence-driven design to guide the future of advanced bone regeneration therapies.",

    "abstract": "Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs broadly distributed in eukaryotes, are emerging as pivotal regulators in the field of epigenomics. In addition to guiding 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation modifications at specific rRNA sites to maintain ribosomal stability and support protein synthesis, snoRNAs have been increasingly implicated in epigenetic regulation, influencing gene expression, chromatin architecture, and RNA modification patterns. Accurate identification of potential snoRNA-disease associations (SDAs) is therefore essential for understanding epigenomic dysregulation in complex diseases and facilitating early intervention and drug repurposing. Although artificial intelligence (AI) methods have advanced SDA prediction, they are still hindered by issues such as sample imbalance and high false-negative rates. To address these challenges, we propose ESAE-SDA, a novel model integrating sparse autoencoders with an ensemble learning framework. ESAE-SDA first constructs a comprehensive snoRNA-disease representation using multi-source similarity metrics. It then applies k-means clustering to select high-confidence negative samples and employs a deep sparse autoencoder with sparsity constraints to learn compact, discriminative embeddings. Finally, multiple GNN-based learners are independently trained on dynamically resampled data, and ensemble inference is performed via weighted fusion, substantially enhancing robustness and generalization. Experiments on a public SDA dataset demonstrate that ESAE-SDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, a case study on ophthalmic diseases highlights the model's ability to uncover epigenetically relevant snoRNAs with potential regulatory and therapeutic significance, underscoring its value in epigenomics-driven disease research and target discovery.",

    "abstract": "Osborne fractionation remains a cornerstone in food science for categorizing seed storage proteins (SSPs), yet molecular distinctions among the classes remain unclear. This study employs a computational framework integrating structural modeling, AI (artificial intelligence)-driven classification, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate these underlying physicochemical differences. Using a dataset of 1039 SSPs from 215 species, sequence and structural-based features were extracted and compared to identify class-specific characteristics, such as low hydrophobic patch area of albumins. Machine learning (ML) classifiers, including binary support vector machines and graph convolutional networks were trained on these features, achieving validation and test accuracies ranging from 96.0 % to 100.0 %. Model interpretations using SHapley Additive exPlanations and saliency mapping revealed key distinguishing features between albumin/prolamin and globulin/glutelin, respectively. For the albumin and prolamin classes, physicochemical feature comparisons and ML classifiers identified factors underlying their solubility differences, such as the low abundance of charged residues in prolamins. On the other hand, although certain features, such as mean surface electric potential, distinguished globulins from glutelins, no clear association was found between these features and experimental solubility trend. Notably, saliency analysis of globulins and glutelins highlighted loop and helical regions outside the conserved β-barrel motifs, where compositional differences in glutamic acid, glycine, serine, and glutamine residues were observed. MD simulations explored solvent-specific conformational changes in representative SSPs, with all-atomic simulations performed on single monomers and coarse-grained simulations conducted with multiple monomers. For 2S soy albumin and 19 kDa maize prolamin, distinct hydrogen bonding patterns was observed during their adaptations to 70 % ethanol environment, and the expected aggregation tendency was reproduced in the multiple-monomer simulation. Taken together with the highlighted features in ML classification, these results suggest that the experimental solubility of albumins and prolamins can be explained at the monomeric level. However, for pea legumin A (globulin) and rice glutelin A1, no clear differences in structural and aggregation dynamics were observed, and monomeric properties alone failed to account for their distinct solubility. These findings suggest that glutelin insolubility is likely dictated by inter-protein disulfide networks rather than intrinsic monomeric characteristics, aligning with previous experimental observations.",

Among the existing computational docking methods, Python docking (pyDock) has shown competitive predictive rates and high robustness over the years. However, the field has dramatically changed with the appearance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, like AlphaFold. While structure prediction of individual proteins is virtually solved by this program, the focus is now on how to improve the prediction of challenging cases like antibody-antigen complexes, multiprotein complexes, weak interactions, or highly flexible interacting proteins. Successful strategies are based on the generation of more diverse sets of models and the integration with other \"classical\" approaches that facilitate the identification of the correct models. Here, we will show in practical terms how to combine the structural modeling capabilities of AlphaFold with the energy-based scoring function in pyDock to improve structural predictions in challenging protein-protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and translational research play a decisive role in advancing evidence-based endodontics by bridging basic science with clinical applications. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and advances in clinical and translational research in Endodontics, addressing methodological foundations, diagnostic challenges, and emerging technologies. It highlights the importance of well-designed randomized controlled trials, robust outcome definitions, and the inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures. The integration of advanced imaging, particularly cone-beam computed tomography, has significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment monitoring. Molecular biology techniques, including polymerase chain reaction and biomarker profiling, have expanded the understanding of endodontic microbiome, immune responses, and host factors related to treatment outcomes. Despite these advances, persistent limitations include diagnostic imprecision, lack of standardized criteria, and underutilization of biomarkers and omics data in clinical practice. The rise of precision dentistry, propelled by genomics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, holds the potential to revolutionize endodontic care through personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Bridging existing gaps will require rigorous study designs, coordinated multicenter efforts, and the effective integration of molecular diagnostics, all of which are critical to advancing endodontic science and optimizing patient outcomes. Likewise, the full potential of translational science can be harnessed to reshape the future of endodontics.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of generative large language models (LLMs) necessitates a fundamental reevaluation of traditional didactic lectures in medical education, particularly within psychiatry. The specialty's inherent diagnostic ambiguity, biopsychosocial complexity, and reliance on nuanced interpersonal skills demand an educational model that transcends mere information transfer, focusing instead on cultivating sophisticated clinical reasoning. This viewpoint argues for a shift from passive knowledge transmission to active, facilitated development of higher-order thinking, aligning with the Bloom taxonomy. We describe four core propositions: (1) shifting foundational knowledge acquisition to faculty-curated asynchronous artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted micromodules; (2) transforming synchronous time into \"Ambiguity Seminars\" for discussing nuanced cases, biopsychosocial formulation, and ethical dilemmas, leveraging faculty expertise in guiding reasoning; (3) integrating live LLM critical interaction drills to develop prompt engineering skills and critical appraisal of AI outputs; and (4) realigning assessment methods (eg, objective structured clinical examinations [OSCEs], reflective writing) to evaluate clinical reasoning and integrative skills rather than rote recall. Successful implementation requires comprehensive faculty development, explicit institutional investment, and a phased approach that addresses scalability across varying resource settings. This reimagined approach aims to cultivate clinical wisdom, equipping psychiatric trainees with adaptive reasoning frameworks essential for excellence in an AI-mediated future.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaques are complex and heterogeneous structures, originating as fatty streaks in the vasculature and formed by the accumulation of lipids and foam cells. Over time, these lesions progress as inflammation, smooth muscle cell proliferation and phenotypic switching, and extracellular matrix deposition contribute to plaque growth, culminating in their fracture, reactive thrombogenesis, and a cardiovascular event such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Traditional bulk mass spectrometry (MS) analysis has yielded critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of plaque formation and disease progression, but it is unable to determine the spatial heterogeneity and microenvironmental complexity within the lesion. Recent advances in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) based omics, including spatial lipidomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have enabled unprecedented visualization of molecular distribution in atherosclerotic plaques at cellular resolution. These techniques promise to elucidate the distinct cellular crosstalk, lesion vulnerability, and sex-specific disease mechanisms that contribute to plaque development and rupture. This review examines the recent advances in MS-based spatial omics and their application to atherosclerotic plaques in both experimental models and human samples. We highlight recent findings, explore their implications for precision medicine and translational research, and discuss current challenges in sample preparation and data integration. Despite challenges, we suggest approaches for integration of MS-based spatial omics using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance data integration, interpretation, and translational applications in atherosclerosis research. These advances promise to broaden our understanding of atherosclerosis and identify novel therapeutic targets to limit the burden of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) criteria provide an important framework for evaluating treatment efficacy and tumour progression in clinical studies of paediatric brain tumours. As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly transforms clinical practice, integrating AI into the RAPNO framework presents a unique opportunity to enhance quantitative, data-driven approaches for response assessment. However, successful clinical implementation faces challenges, including variability in imaging protocols, scarce annotated datasets, and regulatory and ethical considerations. To address these barriers, this Policy Review, led by the AI for Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (AI-RAPNO) subcommittee, outlines key challenges and proposes recommendations to improve AI trustworthiness, generalisability, and implementation in paediatric neuro-oncology. We highlight the potential of AI for response assessment, multimodal integration, and synthetic control groups in clinical trials. Our recommendations emphasise the need for standardised imaging protocols, robust validation frameworks, and infrastructure to support AI readiness in clinical studies. By addressing these needs, AI-RAPNO aims to bridge the gap between AI research and clinical application, ensuring reliable and actionable AI-driven tools for paediatric neuro-oncology.",

    "abstract": "Managing valvular heart disease (VHD) requires integrating multimodal data, including demographics, symptoms, biomarkers, electrocardiogram findings, and imaging studies. However, the capacity and processing power of the human mind are limited, particularly in the current era where vast quantities of complex data require rapid processing. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the management of VHD offers an opportunity to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline clinical workflows, optimize procedural strategies, and predict outcomes and disease progression. Subsets of AI such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms can uncover the unseen data from routine investigations (eg, electrocardiograms, echocardiography, and computed tomography), providing robust and accurate risk prediction tools to inform personalized treatment strategies. Intraprocedurally, AI-based enhancements in imaging guidance can be leveraged to improve procedural safety and success. Digital twin technology can allow case-specific disease modelling, such as simulating valve designs and predicting adverse events, fostering precision medicine. By using the full potential of AI, clinicians can provide a comprehensive, personalized management strategy for VHD patients, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes. However, models based on AI algorithms require rigorous validation across multiple centers to ensure their reliability. Concerns about bias, data privacy, and limited transparency challenge the application of AI decision-making to digital health care. This review discusses the applications of AI in the management of patients with VHD, highlights the future directions of AI technologies, and considers the challenges of integrating AI into clinical practice.",

This review explores the public health strategies deployed across the African continent during the pandemic, highlighting key successes, identifying critical failures, and synthesizing lessons to inform future health emergency preparedness. Drawing on existing literature, policy documents, and epidemiological data, the study examines the roles of leadership, community engagement, health communication, diagnostic capacity, and vaccine deployment. While several African countries successfully leveraged past epidemic experience, decentralized health systems, and innovative communication strategies, others struggled with misinformation, weak surveillance, and limited critical care infrastructure. The review also discusses the role of international collaboration, local innovation, and donor dependence in shaping response outcomes. Lessons from Africa's handling of COVID-19 underline the importance of strengthening public health infrastructure, investing in health workforce development, improving health information systems, and ensuring equitable access to vaccines and therapeutics. This paper contributes to the growing discourse on pandemic preparedness and highlights Africa's potential not only as a site of vulnerability but also of resilience and innovation in global public health.",

    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of disaster response, integrating advanced digital technologies is critical to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of public health systems. Traditional anomaly detection methods often fall short due to their inability to handle the dynamic, heterogeneous, and real-time nature of disaster-related data. These methods typically rely on static models that struggle with integrating continuous data streams from diverse sources like hospitals, emergency services, social media, and environmental sensors. As a result, they often fail to capture sudden shifts in disease patterns, environmental conditions, or population movements, leading to delayed risk identification and suboptimal decisions. The increasing frequency and complexity of natural disasters and pandemics underscore the need for flexible, adaptive systems capable of learning from evolving data. Recent advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics offer promising tools to address these limitations by enabling real-time, high-dimensional data analysis. In recent years, the integration of advanced digital technologies has become essential for improving public health disaster response.",

    "abstract": "As the global population ages rapidly, the number of older adults experiencing critical illness is increasing significantly. This growing demographic presents substantial challenges for critical care systems worldwide. However, older patients are frequently underrepresented in clinical research and often receive suboptimal care due to assumptions about low productivity, the presence of multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, and altered physiological responses to illness and treatment. These factors contribute to a paucity of targeted studies and evidence-based guidelines for managing critical illness in geriatric populations. In contrast to younger patients, older adults often place greater emphasis on long-term outcomes and quality of life rather than survival alone. As a result, the clinical management of critical illness in this population involves distinct and complex considerations.",

This study aims to identify genomic markers associated with increased mortality in toxic liver disease, using the KEM® (Knowledge Extraction and Management) explainable Artificial Intelligence platform. From 225 participants diagnosed with toxic liver disease within the UK Biobank cohort, data were consolidated, including survival outcomes, clinical phenotypes, comorbidities, and 36 394 genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) focusing on liver-related pathways. Fifteen SNPs were found to be significantly associated with increased mortality risk, notably rs73158145 in the PRKAG2 gene. Predictive models built on these selected SNPs achieved a mean accuracy of 85%, outperforming models without pre-selection (68.9% accuracy).

    "abstract": "Foodborne pathogens remain a significant public health concern, necessitating the development of rapid, sensitive, and reliable detection methods for various food matrices. Traditional biosensors, while effective in many contexts, often face limitations related to complex sample environments, signal interpretation, and on-site usability. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into biosensing platforms offers a transformative approach to address these challenges. This review critically examines recent advancements in AI-assisted biosensors for detecting foodborne pathogens in various food samples, including meat, dairy products, fresh produce, and ready-to-eat foods. Emphasis is placed on the application of machine learning and deep learning to improve biosensor accuracy, reduce detection time, and automate data interpretation. AI models have demonstrated capabilities in enhancing sensitivity, minimizing false results, and enabling real-time, on-site analysis through innovative interfaces. Additionally, the review highlights the types of biosensing mechanisms employed, such as electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric, and how AI optimizes their performance. While these developments show promising outcomes, challenges remain in terms of data quality, algorithm transparency, and regulatory acceptance. The future integration of standardized datasets, explainable AI models, and robust validation protocols will be essential to fully harness the potential of AI-enhanced biosensors for next-generation food safety monitoring.",

Foundation models, originally developed for natural language processing, are now driving transformative approaches to high-dimensional, multimodal single-cell data analysis. Frameworks such as scGPT and scPlantFormer excel in cross-species cell annotation, in silico perturbation modeling, and gene regulatory network inference. Multimodal integration approaches, including pathology-aligned embeddings and tensor-based fusion, harmonize transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial imaging data to delineate multilayered regulatory networks across biological scales. Federated computational platforms facilitate decentralized data analysis and standardized, reproducible workflows, fostering global collaboration. Challenges persist, including technical variability across platforms, limited model interpretability, and gaps in translating computational insights into clinical applications. Overcoming these hurdles demands standardized benchmarking, multimodal knowledge graphs, and collaborative frameworks that integrate artificial intelligence with human expertise.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality globally and in Italy, with a growing burden exacerbated by aging populations and underdeveloped strategies for managing chronic cardiovascular conditions. This position paper, resulting from the 2024 ANMCO General Assembly, addresses the current state of cardiovascular chronicity management in Italy, highlighting critical gaps and proposing sustainable, integrative solutions. Despite improvements in acute cardiovascular care, the lack of structured post-acute management, insufficient adoption of secondary prevention protocols, limited access to innovative therapies, and a slow digital transition continue to hinder effective chronic care. The document stresses the pivotal role of cardiologists, not only in acute intervention but also in long-term care and secondary prevention, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary, multichannel healthcare model. The paper explores the potential of e-Health and artificial intelligence to revolutionize chronic disease management. It advocates for the widespread implementation of integrated care pathways, digital tools like electronic health records and telemedicine platforms, which together could enhance early detection, patient monitoring, and therapeutic adherence while reducing unnecessary hospitalizations. It also underscores the necessity of updating national and regional pharmaceutical policies to improve equitable access to disease-modifying therapies. Furthermore, the integration of palliative care in end-stage cardiovascular disease and the enhancement of post-acute care networks are deemed essential. Ultimately, the document advocates for a comprehensive systemic and cultural transformation - spearheaded by scientific societies such as ANMCO - where technological innovation, organizational reform, and patient-centered care align to ensure a sustainable and universally accessible healthcare system. This vision is consistent with the objectives of the PNRR, the 2030 Agenda, and, most importantly, the foundational principles of the Italian Constitution.",

Unlike conventional AI, which analyzes existing data, synthetic AI generates new, patient-like clinical content, signals, images, virtual populations, and personalized treatment simulations, based on learned patterns. This review provides clinicians with a clear and practical overview of core generative technologies, including generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, transformers, diffusion models, autoregressive architectures, digital twins, and synthetic cohort simulators. Each method is illustrated through real-world cardiovascular use cases, from ECG generation to risk stratification, virtual trial design, and procedural planning. Beyond technical explanation, the article explores current regulatory, ethical, and validation challenges, highlighting how synthetic AI can enhance diagnostics, training, and clinical decision-making, particularly in data-limited settings. Far from replacing physicians, these tools extend clinical reach and invite the medical community to take an active role in shaping their responsible use. Synthetic AI is no longer a theoretical innovation, it is a growing infrastructure. Understanding its capabilities, limitations, and clinical relevance will be essential for the cardiologist of tomorrow.",

To overcome these diagnostic challenges, this article provides a systematic review of recent advancements and ongoing debates in GERD diagnostics, with a focus on the diagnostic value of multimodal parameters as outlined in the Lyon Consensus 2.0. It also explores the clinical relevance of emerging auxiliary diagnostic metrics. We emphasize that integrating clinical symptomatology, endoscopic findings, esophageal physiological measurements, and psychosocial factors (augmented by composite scoring systems and artificial intelligence), offers a promising strategy for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment of GERD.",

    "abstract": "Long-term exposure to microgravity influences musculoskeletal health and enhances the likelihood of sustaining orthopedic injuries while on a microgravity mission and upon return to Earth. Although countermeasures are being investigated to alleviate some risks of injury, such as resistive (or weight) exercise and Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP), evidence is accumulating that current paradigms do not ensure the safety or health of astronauts because of a lack of in-flight diagnostic methods, in which load/diagnostic metrics can be assessed over time. Here, we suggest the integration of a new vision-language large language model (DeepSeek-VL) as a potential autonomous diagnostic agent for monitoring musculoskeletal health in a microgravity environment. DeepSeek-VL will autonomously analyze radiographic data and biomechanical data streamed from a LBNP device. Determinations will be made based on lost or compromised density in bone, lost joint-centered stability, or ineffective loading patterns - providing personalized and specific feedback regarding musculoskeletal health with the astronaut as the primary user. Unlike conventional reporting approaches that rely on cross-institutional analysis by household experts, DeepSeek-VL allows for real-time, and autonomous interpretation of musculoskeletal imaging metrics (and physiological metrics) for on-time personalized countermeasure development. Here, we review architectural adaptations including microgravity specific samplings of data, training protocols and implications of deployment in the ISS. We anticipate DeepSeek's timely development of flight-ready diagnostic reporting will facilitate in-flight/systematic monitoring of musculoskeletal health and safety, especially for astronauts undergoing load management training (e.g., LBNP) and ensure effectiveness of countermeasures, their outputs. We will address methods to circumvent limitations and barriers to risk, and establish the importance of a federated, adaptive, and resilient AI-based platform to mitigate risk for astronaut musculoskeletal health during extended missions. Finally, we address some considerations for terrestrial model and a healthcare authority within a current context of growing importance for effective orthopedic healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, uses large datasets to identify patterns between potential predictors and outcomes. ML involves iterative learning from data and is increasingly used in population and public health. Examples include early warning of infectious disease outbreaks, predicting the future burden of noncommunicable diseases, and assessing public health interventions. However, ML can inadvertently produce biased outputs related to the quality and quantity of data, who is engaged and helping direct the analysis, and how findings are interpreted. Specific guidelines for using ML in population and public health have not yet been created. We assembled a diverse team of experts in computer science, statistical modeling, clinical and population health epidemiology, health economics, ethics, sociology, and public health. Drawing on literature reviews and a modified Delphi process, we identified five key recommendations: (1) prioritize partnerships and interventions to support communities considered structurally disadvantaged; (2) use ML for dynamic situations, such as public health emergencies, while adhering to ethical standards; (3) conduct risk assessments and bias mitigation strategies aligned with identified risks; (4) ensure technical transparency and reproducibility by publicly sharing data sources and methodologies; and (5) foster multidisciplinary dialogue to discuss the potential harms of ML-related bias and raise awareness among the public and public health community. The proposed guidelines provide operational steps for stakeholders, ensuring that ML tools are not only effective but also ethically grounded and feasible in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible graphical interfaces. We introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable framework for anomaly detection in biological networks. E-ABIN combines classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating algorithms such as support vector machines, random forests, graph autoencoders, and graph adversarial attributed networks, E-ABIN ensures high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and celiac disease, where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers insights into disease mechanisms. E-ABIN is freely available on the Zenodo platform at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17062501.",

    "abstract": "Mentorship plays a vital role in building research capacity, advancing evidence-based medicine, and fostering innovation in clinical practice, particularly in Africa, where Human Resources for Health (HRH) remain a persistent and complex challenge. Health mentors offer invaluable support by guiding early-career researchers in both clinical and research domains, thereby contributing to the mitigation of healthcare challenges across the continent. Effective mentorship enhances productivity, research quality, and professional networking opportunities. Africa's HRH landscape is marked by significant obstacles, including the brain drain of experienced professionals, outdated research infrastructure, limited funding, and the absence of structured mentorship programs for emerging researchers. The shortage of skilled mentors deprives young professionals of critical guidance, hindering their ability to produce high-quality research and to effectively address pressing local health issues through evidence-based practice. To address these challenges, this article proposes innovative strategies to actively engage young African researchers and establish structured, sustainable mentorship programs that empower them to participate in research-driven decision-making. It also calls on the African Union to adopt policies that prioritize research and allocate dedicated funding for mentorship initiatives. Additionally, leveraging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification can enhance mentorship effectiveness, accessibility, and engagement. Moreover, the promotion of international exchange programs would offer young African researchers valuable exposure, broaden their technical skills, and strengthen global networks. In conclusion, strengthening mentorship frameworks, improving research infrastructure, and investing in the next generation of researchers are critical steps toward addressing Africa's health challenges and advancing its scientific leadership.",

SADs are associated with an increased risk of recurrent and severe infections, hospitalisation, and impaired quality of life. Despite this, diagnostic and treatment pathways remain inconsistent across healthcare settings and regions. Recent advances in the use of structured clinical data, including electronic health records and systematic laboratory assessments, show promise in facilitating earlier recognition of SADs. These approaches support more timely treatment decisions and promote consistent standards of care. Achieving improved outcomes for individuals with SADs will require broader consensus on diagnostic criteria, treatment thresholds, and access to specialist immunology services.",

    "abstract": "Environmental challenges such as drought, salinity, heavy metal contamination, and nutrient deficiencies threaten global agricultural productivity and food security. These stressors drastically reduce crop yields, necessitating innovative solutions. Recent advancements in omics-based research-spanning genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and phenomics-have transformed our understanding of plant stress responses at the molecular level. High-throughput sequencing, mass spectrometry, and computational biology have facilitated the identification of stress-responsive genes, proteins, and metabolites critical for enhancing plant resilience. This review evaluates omics-driven strategies for improving crop performance under environmental stress. It emphasizes multi-omics data integration, precision breeding, artificial intelligence (AI) in crop modeling, and genome-editing technologies. Notably, breakthroughs in machine learning and AI have refined predictive modeling, enabling precise selection of stress-tolerant traits and optimizing breeding strategies. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the complexity of multi-omics data analysis, high technology costs, and regulatory barriers. Bridging the gap between research and practical applications requires developing cost-effective platforms, enhancing AI-driven models, and conducting large-scale field validations. This review highlights the transformative potential of omics technologies to develop climate-resilient crops. By integrating these advanced methodologies, agriculture can achieve sustainable food production and bolster global food security in the face of climate change and environmental stressors.",

The chronic pathogenesis of BPD with complex prenatal and postnatal programming challenges attempts at precisely defining or treating disease. While existing BPD definitions categorize disease severity, a lack of consideration of disease heterogeneity and endotypes has contributed to the failure of clinical trials to improve BPD outcomes. Recent studies have used advanced lung imaging techniques, echocardiography, and lung function tests to identify airway, parenchymal, and vascular BPD endotypes. These endotypes carry different prognoses and require endotype-specific treatment strategies to optimize infant outcomes.

    "abstract": "Chemical staining methods, while reliable, are time consuming and can be resource-intensive, involving costly chemical reagents and raising environmental concerns. This underscores the compelling need for alternative solutions such as virtual staining, which not only accelerates the diagnostic process but also enhances the flexibility of stain applications without the associated physical and chemical costs. Generative artificial intelligence technologies prove to be immensely useful in addressing these challenges. However, in healthcare, particularly within computational pathology, the high-stakes nature of decisions complicates the adoption of these tools due to their often opaque processes. Our work introduces an innovative approach that harnesses generative models for virtual stain transformations, improving performance, trustworthiness, scalability, and adaptability within computational pathology. The core of the proposed methodology involves a singular Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) encoder that supports multiple stain decoders. This design prioritizes critical regions in the latent space of H&E tissues, leading to a richer representation that enables precise synthetic stain generation by the decoders. Tested to simultaneously generate eight different stains from a single H&E slide, our method also offers significant scalability benefits for routine use by loading only necessary model components during production. We integrate label-free knowledge during training, using loss functions and regularization to minimize artifacts, thereby enhancing the accuracy of virtual staining in both paired and unpaired settings. To build trust in these synthetic stains, we employ a real-time self-inspection methodology using trained discriminators for each stain type, providing pathologists with confidence heatmaps to aid in their evaluations. In addition, we perform automatic quality checks on new H&E slides to ensure that they conform to the trained H&E distribution, guaranteeing the generation of high-quality synthetic stained slides. Recognizing the challenges pathologists face in adopting new technologies, we have encapsulated our method in an open-source, cloud-based proof-of-concept system. This system enables users to easily and virtually stain their H&E slides through a browser, eliminating the need for specialized technical knowledge and addressing common hardware and software challenges. It also facilitates real-time user feedback integration. Lastly, we have curated a novel dataset comprising eight different paired H&E/stains related to pediatric Crohn's disease at diagnosis, providing 30 whole slide images (WSIs) for each stain set (total of 480 WSIs) to stimulate further research in computational pathology.",

    "abstract": "Violence risk assessment is a critical component of psychiatric practice, with significant clinical, ethical, and legal implications. Psychiatric patients at high risk of violence often face interventions including restraints, intramuscular injections, and involuntary hospitalization. Agitated and aggressive behaviours from patients have been linked to high hospital costs due to increased length of stay, readmissions, increased medication use, staff injury, and need for high acuity monitoring. Traditional risk assessment tools can be time intensive and have poor generalizability to civil populations. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential for enhancing the precision of violence risk assessments. Although AI can address the technical issues of risk assessment, its implementation will raise new ethical and legal challenges. In psychiatry, AI-assisted violence risk assessment intersects with mental health law, particularly criteria for preventive detention and the ethical boundaries of AI-driven decisions. There have been some early concerns about racial bias, lack of transparency, accountability, and disruption to current practices in psychiatric care. To our knowledge, there have been no efforts to synthesize the ethical and legal implications for this particular use case. To address these gaps, we conducted a scoping review to map the literature on the ethical and legal considerations of AI in violence risk assessment in acute psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Africa's vast genetic diversity poses challenges for optimising drug treatments in the continent, which is exacerbated by the fact that drug discovery and development efforts have historically been performed outside Africa. This has led to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes in African populations and overall scarcity of relevant pharmacogenetic data, including characteristic genotypes as well as drugs prescribed in the continent to treat infectious diseases. Here, we propose a general approach to identify drug-gene pairs with potential pharmacogenetic interest. Our pipeline couples machine learning and artificial intelligence with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and non-linear mixed effects (NLME) modelling to hypothesize which pharmacogenes could be of potential clinical interest, and which dose adjustments could be made to provide better treatment outcomes for African populations. Drug-gene pairs are first ranked with the latest knowledge embedding techniques, based on public structural and bioactivity data for drugs and genes, followed by a large language model-based refinement. Selected genes are then evaluated for their sensitivity in PBPK analysis, and relevant variants subsequently inspected with NLME for dose optimization. The analysis is focused on genes with potential clinical relevance in Africa. We delve deeper into malaria and tuberculosis therapies, many of which remain uncharacterised from a pharmacogenetic perspective.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, multimodal data integration has become an important means to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment in gastroenterology and hepatology. This article systematically reviews the latest progress of multimodal AI technology in the diagnosis, treatment, and decision-making for gastrointestinal tumors, functional gastrointestinal diseases, and liver diseases, focusing on the innovative applications of endoscopic image AI, pathological section AI, multi-omics data fusion models, and wearable devices combined with natural language processing. Multimodal AI can significantly improve the accuracy of early diagnosis and the efficiency of individualized treatment planning by integrating imaging, pathological data, molecular, and clinical phenotypic data. However, current AI technologies still face challenges such as insufficient data standardization, limited generalization of models, and ethical compliance. This paper proposes solutions, such as the establishment of cross-center data sharing platform, the development of federated learning framework, and the formulation of ethical norms, and looks forward to the application prospect of multimodal large-scale models in the disease management process. This review provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for promoting the clinical translation of AI technology in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a recently developed artificial intelligence (AI)-based language model that has become an increasingly common source of health-related information due to its accessibility. However, there is limited evidence regarding the accuracy and reliability of its responses. Objective: This study aimed to assess ChatGPT’s usability in otolaryngology by analyzing its answers to common patient questions. Method: 24 patient-oriented questions were created across 10 otolaryngological disease categories and submitted sequentially to ChatGPT version 4.0. The generated responses were evaluated from a linguistic perspective and 6 board-certified otolaryngologists using a three-point scale: incorrect (1), correct but incomplete (2), and correct (3). Results: Language evaluations indicated that the responses were generally clear, well-structured, and of good quality for further medical evaluations. ChatGPT’s medical accuracy scores ranged from 2.00 to 2.83. Three specific questions (Q4, Q9, Q24) received significantly lower ratings. Four raters (R1, R2, R4, R6) showed strong agreement in their evaluations, while significant differences emerged between the scores of R3 and R5 (p<0.001). Conclusion: ChatGPT’s responses in otolaryngology were coherent and well-structured, but the accuracy of medical content varied by topic. While the tool may be beneficial for basic patient education, it is not currently reliable enough to support clinical decision-making. Future development of validated, specialty-specific artificial intelligence systems based on trustworthy medical sources will be crucial for safe implementation in healthcare.

    "abstract": "The ophthalmic route for drug administration remains a significant constraint in ophthalmology due to the unique anatomy and several protective barriers in the eyes, which limit absorption and therapeutic efficacy. Conventionally, drugs are delivered to the eye through various types of formulations, including eye drops (solutions, suspensions, and emulsions), ointments and gels, in-situ gels, and periocular injections. While effective, they suffer from various drawbacks, including poor bioavailability (<5%), reflex blinking, tear turnover, nasolacrimal drainage, and frequent dosing requirements. A key challenge remains: ensuring sufficient drug reaches the target area for the desired effect. This necessitates developing sophisticated drug delivery systems capable of site-specific controlled release within the ocular tissue, including implantable and insertable devices. In 2024, the global ocular implant market reached a valuation of USD 15.72 billion and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5.8 % from 2025 to 2030, fuelled by increasing demand for minimally invasive and long-acting treatment options. These devices are not only used for sustained and controlled drug delivery but also play an important role in correcting refractive error through intraocular lenses. Recent advancements, including artificial intelligence, IoTconnected devices, smart stimuli-responsive materials, and precision 3D printing, are significantly enhancing the diagnostic, monitoring, and management purposes of ocular conditions in modern ophthalmic care. This review provides a detailed analysis of various implantable and insertable technologies, ranging from Intacs rings, ocular ring inserts, and drug-eluting contact lenses to intracameral implants, conjunctival inserts, intraocular lenses/inlays, injected micro- and nanoparticles, intravitreal implants, and microneedles. For each category, we examine the working mechanisms, clinical applications, technological innovations, and design considerations, with a focus on segmented drug delivery for the anterior and posterior regions. The review also highlights clinical applications, provides an overview of marketed, patented, and FDA-approved devices in the U.S., and outlines ongoing clinical trials. Additionally, it addresses the difficulties in translating research into clinical practice, recent technological advancements, and future directions for navigating regulatory barriers in the development of these devices. Through highlighting critical research gaps, this review intends to influence the advancement of ocular implants and inserts. This article aims to guide future developments in the domain of ocular therapeutics through implantable and insertable drug delivery devices.",

Here we describe a range of such potential failure modes contributing to diagnostic error in the practice of diagnostic radiology and summarize evolving efforts to mitigate them. These include fostering the adoption of peer learning and other feedback and education programs, a range of measures under development for ongoing performance evaluation of radiologists and their work-processes, and the deployment of new technologies, most notably artificial intelligence tools, to augment human performance and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy in Radiology.",

However, implementing personalized and scalable rehabilitation programs remains challenging. This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI), when integrated with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, can transform cancer rehabilitation through personalized exercise prescriptions, real-time monitoring, virtual coaching, and data-driven decision-making. We also discuss the role of emerging technologies such as virtual reality, wearables, and telehealth in expanding access to care. While limitations regarding data bias, equity, and regulation persist, strategic research and implementation efforts are essential.

    "abstract": "Taste peptides have emerged as promising natural flavoring agents attributed to their unique organoleptic properties, high safety profile, and potential health benefits. However, the de novo identification of taste peptides derived from animal, plant, or microbial sources remains a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, significantly impeding their widespread application in the food industry. In this work, we present TastePepAI, a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework for customized taste peptide design and safety assessment. As the key element of this framework, a loss-supervised adaptive variational autoencoder (LA-VAE) is implemented to efficiently optimize the latent representation of sequences during training and facilitate the generation of target peptides with desired taste profiles. Notably, our model incorporates a novel taste-avoidance mechanism, allowing for selective flavor exclusion. Subsequently, our in-house developed toxicity prediction algorithm (SpepToxPred) is integrated in the framework to undergo rigorous safety evaluation of generated peptides. Using this integrated platform, we successfully identified 73 peptides exhibiting sweet, salty, and umami, significantly expanding the current repertoire of taste peptides. This work demonstrates the potential of TastePepAI in accelerating taste peptide discovery for food applications and provides a versatile framework adaptable to broader peptide engineering challenges.",

    "abstract": "Conventional upper limb rehabilitation methods often encounter significant obstacles, including high costs, limited accessibility, and reduced patient adherence. Emerging technological solutions, such as telerehabilitation, virtual reality (VR), and wearable sensor-based systems, address some of these challenges but still face issues concerning supervision quality, affordability, and usability. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an innovative and cost-effective rehabilitation system based on advanced computer vision techniques and artificial intelligence (AI). Developed using Python (3.11.5), the proposed system utilizes a standard webcam in conjunction with robust pose estimation algorithms to provide real-time analysis of patient movements during guided upper limb exercises. Instructional exercise videos featuring an NAO robot facilitate patient engagement and consistency in practice. The system generates instant quantitative feedback on movement precision, repetition accuracy, and exercise phase completion. The core advantages of the proposed approach include minimal equipment requirements, affordability, ease of setup, and enhanced interactive guidance compared to traditional telerehabilitation methods. By reducing the complexity and expense associated with many VR and wearable-sensor solutions, while acknowledging that some lower-cost and haptic-enabled VR options exist, this single-webcam approach aims to broaden access to guided home rehabilitation without specialized hardware.",

    "abstract": "Beach water testing for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) is a key element of public health protection for beachgoers. Because the process can be expensive and time-consuming, many beaches are infrequently monitored, putting the health of the public at risk. Machine learning (ML) models using large sets of FIB, weather, and other types of environmental data have been applied to predict FIB levels at beaches. If ML models developed using data from frequently monitored beaches in one location could be effectively applied to another location (referred to as \"generalization\"), public health protections could be easily extended to those infrequently monitored beaches. We found that source to target generalization augmented by transfer learning (TL) can predict FIB threshold exceedance with a specificity of 0.70 to 0.81 and sensitivity ranging from 0.28 to 0.76, depending on the beaches and TL methods. This degree of specificity and the high end of the sensitivity range are comparable to the performance of regression and ML models developed by using data from a given beach and applied to that same beach. With the addition of TL, we observed statistically significant improvements in model performance over source to target generalization, with increases of 28.3% in WF1 scores and 5.4% in AUC. Future research into optimizing the selection of data-rich source beaches for developing models that can be applied to a given target beach may further improve transfer learning.",

In recent years, exosomes (EXOs) - membrane-bound vesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) that mediate intercellular communication by shuttling proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids - have emerged as promising targets for unraveling RA pathogenesis and developing novel therapies. As key carriers of biological signals, EXOs regulate synovial microenvironment dynamics, including fibroblast-like synoviocyte activation, macrophage polarization, and inflammatory cytokine secretion, thereby playing dual roles in promoting or alleviating RA progression. However, research at this interdisciplinary nexus remains fragmented, lacking systematic synthesis. To address this gap, we employed CiteSpace software to generate a knowledge map from 244 Web of Science Core Collection documents (2000-2025), analyzing global research trends, thematic evolution, and collaborative networks. Key findings include: Growth in academic output: the number of publications continues to rise year by year, with the total number of citations exceeding 9723, significantly enhancing academic influence. Geographical distribution: China leads with 145 publications (centrality = 0.57), followed by the United States. Notably, emerging research hubs in Iran and Germany have recently intensified activity. Thematic priorities: research hotspots cluster around 3 domains: anti-inflammatory activity of EXOs (e.g., M2 macrophage-derived EXOs modulating immune balance), metabolic reprogramming of fibroblast-like synoviocytes regulated by EXO-carried molecules (e.g., circRNAs, miRNAs), and cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-driven immune dysregulation and EXOs-mediated cfDNA clearance. Frontier areas include engineered EXOs delivery systems (e.g., targeted modification for joint enrichment) and cfDNA-mediated immunomodulatory mechanisms. Collaborative landscape: while international partnerships have formed, interdisciplinary integration remains biased toward biomedical sciences. Contributions from materials science and artificial intelligence remain nascent, underscoring opportunities for cross-sector innovation. This analysis provides the first comprehensive knowledge framework for the RA-EXOs interface, offering researchers a roadmap for strategic topic selection, collaboration, and translational innovation toward next generation RA therapies.",

    "abstract": "Persistent pain represents a significant global health challenge, necessitating innovative biomarker technologies that facilitate personalised prediction, prevention, and treatment. Recent advances in omics, encompassing genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, lipidomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics, now permit high-resolution mapping of neuroimmune pathways implicated in pain chronification. Yet, biomarkers must transcend isolated molecular or sensory indicators, integrating emotional, cognitive, functional, and social dimensions of pain. Emerging quantum sensing technologies, such as diamond nitrogen-vacancy sensors and portable magnetoencephalography systems, promise precise and wearable tools capable of real-time, multimodal assessment of pain. Concurrently, transparent machine learning methods combining explainable artificial intelligence with physiologically informed modelling are crucial for managing the vast data complexity inherent to these multidimensional omics approaches. Ultimately, achieving economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and universally accessible pain management solutions requires strategically streamlined methods. Here, we outline a visionary framework of measurement-enabled understanding that enables precision pain medicine with rapid feedback that points toward actionable clinical outcomes, harnessing interdisciplinary innovation to address persistent pain comprehensively, just as genomics and immunotherapy have transformed cancer care.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with over 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway towards ultra-efficient language models. Code: https://github.com/shaochenze/calm.

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review, focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem (CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis, in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.",

First, we establish the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data. Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval.",

We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance, consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model.

    "abstract": "To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves fast convergence. We also use R\\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

The gap stems from two fundamental challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations, and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover, it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all 5 metrics.",

    "abstract": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",

Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2) steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and controllable at minimal marginal cost.",

    "abstract": "The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting, Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2) moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1) momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift. Theoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.",

Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on users past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is new to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical data available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To address this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial ratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early understanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally categorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision tree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about their preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is gathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach for rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i) elicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres to better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at each node to more effectively learn user preferences.

    "abstract": "Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA) methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference, we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2 and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm",

    "abstract": "Enterprise systems are crucial for enhancing productivity and decision-making among employees and customers. Integrating LLM based systems into enterprise systems enables intelligent automation, personalized experiences, and efficient information retrieval, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth. However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings, featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in enterprise-focused AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly 3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level, substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural, and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.   We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap, performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

    "abstract": "The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal, streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any $n \\times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the efficiency of modern recurrent architectures.

We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3% preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual alignment in lightweight LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets, achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work, we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy gains of up to 7.8%.",
