    "abstract": "The emergence of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which hold the ability to generalize to diverse natural language processing tasks, has led to new opportunities in health care. Oncology is especially well-suited to leverage these resources as the journeys of patients with cancer inherently yield extensive, longitudinal data sets comprising clinical narratives, pathology and radiology reports, and genomic sequencing reports. This review begins with an overview of the fundamental concepts behind LLMs, including the definitions, architecture, training paradigm, and performance optimization through prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation. We also take a moment to explore the newly emerging paradigm of LLMs in a multiagentic framework. We then synthesize current research on how LLMs may benefit stakeholders within the practice of oncology, including patients, oncologists, researchers, and learners. Finally, we address the limitations and risks of LLMs, including hallucinations, inherent biases, patient privacy, and clinician deskilling. While research thus far shows significant potential for LLMs to transform cancer care, necessary future directions include studies emphasizing patient stakeholder perspectives on LLM incorporation in clinical workflows, the development of relevant clinical benchmarks for LLM evaluation, a greater focus on real-world prospective testing, and deeper exploration of LLM reasoning capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine has evolved through distinct phases, from the origins of the Human Genome Project to mutation-based targeted therapies. This editorial posits that \"stereological cell biomedicine\" could be a new approach promoting the development of the next generation of precision medicine. This emerging discipline transitions the focus from genomic data to the multi-dimensional and spatiotemporal complexity of single cells. Driven by advances in Stereo single-cell multi-omics (Stereo Cell-seq), spatial transcriptomics (Stereo-seq), and single-cell surfaceomics (sc-surfaceome), this approach aims to capture the stereologically dynamic interactions between organelles within a cell and between cells in the tissue. We argue that understanding the spatiotemporal location of molecules, particularly protein interactions at organelle interfaces and on the cell surface, is as critical as their abundance for defining cellular function in health and disease. Integrating these high-resolution measurements with artificial intelligence and computational modelling will bridge the gap between advanced omics and pathology. Initiatives such as the newly established European Stereo Cell Center (ESCC) signal a global shift towards this new paradigm, which promises to unlock novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for truly multi-factorial and dynamic precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) artificial intelligence models are being increasingly explored in medical education, yet their utility in ophthalmology remains unclear. Slit-lamp anterior segment photography, as a cornerstone of ophthalmic training, provides an ideal context for evaluation. We assessed 40 cases of anterior segment disease. The text descriptions were generated using GPT-4o, and the corresponding images were synthesized via Sora Turbo. Readability was analysed with the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE), Flesch‒Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), and Gunning Fog Scale (GFS). Twenty ophthalmologists (10 juniors, 10 seniors) rated image-text pairs across five dimensions-text accuracy, image reliability, recognizability, educational value, and generation stability-using a 5-point Likert scale. Entities with distinct morphological features, such as cataracts and subconjunctival haemorrhages, received the highest total scores, whereas those with entropion and corneal foreign bodies scored the lowest. Readability analysis indicated advanced text complexity. Senior ophthalmologists consistently provided lower ratings than junior clinicians did, highlighting expertise-related differences in perceived educational value. Sora Turbo can generate clinically useful anterior segment images for educational purposes, particularly for pathologies with prominent morphological features. This first systematic evaluation in ophthalmology demonstrates the promise of AI-generated atlases as scalable teaching resources for early-stage trainees while emphasizing the need for expert validation and ethical oversight before integration into formal curricula.",

In parallel, discordant definitions of treatment success in the literature hinder comparative research and outcome benchmarking. A tiered framework-encompassing infection eradication, surgical burden, joint function, and patient-reported outcomes-offers a path toward standardized and clinically meaningful reporting.➢ Advances in immunogenetics, artificial intelligence-driven risk modeling, and precision medicine, alongside the emergence of research consortia and global collaborations, are opening new frontiers in treatment strategies and creating opportunities for innovative, individualized approaches to PJI management.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms remain a prolific source of bioactive compounds, yet discovery efforts are often hindered by traditional methods and the repeated isolation of known molecules. In the post-genomics era, advances in genome mining and multi-omics technologies have revealed the hidden potential of biosynthetic gene clusters. A major challenge, however, lies in reliably linking these gene clusters to their metabolites and in the activation of silent pathways. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs addressing these challenges, focusing on the most recent case studies (up to 2025), and covering three interconnected themes. First, it reviews the current strengths and limitations of microbial genomics and artificial intelligence in natural product discovery, emphasizing different genome-guided discovery strategies and the emerging applications of artificial intelligence. Second, it highlights strategies for activating silent gene clusters, covering both untargeted and targeted approaches. Third, it discusses the expansion of chemical diversity through bioprospecting in underexplored ecological niches, the integration of sustainable, ethically informed practices, and the development of novel cultivation platforms. By synthesizing these advances, this review provides a forward-looking perspective, proposing how the integration of current tools in one framework can establish a predictive and potentially highly efficient method for linking biosynthetic gene clusters to their metabolites. Such integrative approaches may accelerate the discovery of microbial natural products and contribute sustainable solutions to global health challenges, including antimicrobial resistance. In conclusion, this review represents an up-to-date roadmap for researchers in microbial natural product research from a biological perspective, identifies existing strengths and knowledge gaps, and highlights promising, proof-of-concept strategies that can drive future advances in the field.",

The Society of Digital Psychiatry, in partnership with JMIR Mental Health, presents a 3-pronged road map to accelerate their safe, effective, and equitable implementation. First, education: integrate digital psychiatry into core training and professional development through a global webinar series, annual symposium, newsletter, and an updated open-access curriculum addressing AI and the evolving digital navigator role. Second, AI standards: develop transparent, actionable benchmarks and consensus guidance through initiatives like MindBench.ai to assess reasoning, safety, and representativeness across populations. Third, digital navigators: expand structured, train-the-trainer programs that enhance digital literacy, engagement, and workflow integration across diverse care settings, including low- and middle-income countries. Together, these pillars bridge research and practice, advancing digital psychiatry grounded in inclusivity, accountability, and measurable clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) impose a heavy global health burden, necessitating efficient management strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key transformative tool across the CVD care continuum, and this review systematically synthesizes AI's latest advancements, limitations, and clinical translation pathways in CVD management, adhering to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A literature search was performed in four core databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, IEEE Xplore) for studies published between 2018-2023. After strict screening (inclusion: original research/clinical trials with clear indicators; exclusion: unvalidated studies/conference abstracts), 128 high-quality studies were included, with quality assessed via NOS and QUADAS-2. Key AI applications in CVD management include: (1) Risk prediction: Multimodal models (radiomics-CFD, EHR-imaging) achieve AUC >0.9, but performance declines in elderly patients (>75 years, ΔAUC=0.08-0.12); (2) Diagnosis: Systems like Viz LVO and DeepHemorrhage reduce LVO detection time to 6 minutes and hemorrhage segmentation Dice to 0.94, yet face false positives (3.5-5%) and workflow delays; (3) Therapeutic optimization: Intraoperative AI (eg, Siemens AI-Path) shortens microcatheter placement time by 61%, and pharmacogenomic models cut antiplatelet complications by 37%; (4) Long-term monitoring: Mobile platforms (eg, NeuroVision™) automate NIHSS scoring (ICC=0.93) but lose accuracy in home settings (ICC=0.85-0.88). Critical limitations of current AI include single-center data bias, poor interpretability, and legal risks (unclear misdiagnosis liability). This review proposes three innovative solutions: a \"data-model-clinical\" closed loop, a multidimensional AI value evaluation system, and defining the \"human-AI collaboration boundary\" in neurointerventions. Future directions focus on primary care-adapted lightweight models, comorbidity-specific algorithms, and AI-assisted rehabilitation. This review emphasizes that physician-AI collaboration and standardized frameworks (eg, AI-RADS, WHO-ITU guidelines) are critical for AI's sustainable translation in CVD care. Addressing current gaps will enable AI to further improve therapeutic efficiency and functional outcomes, alleviating the global CVD burden.",

    "abstract": "The article examines the World Health Organization's (WHO) discourse on artificial intelligence (AI) in their foresight exercises, doing so by drawing on the analytical framework of strong and weak AI narratives. The analysis finds that strong AI narratives (those which depict AI as human-like or even super-intelligent, emphasising existential risks and transformative power) are rarely found. In contrast, the exercises produce a broad range of weak AI narratives (those that emphasise the technical limitations, ethical concerns, and practical governance of specific AI applications in healthcare). The findings reveal how certain AI technologies are foregrounded by WHO, how these are framed as in isolation from other emerging technologies, how this isolation is strategically blurred, and the role of expert participation in legitimising WHO's policy on AI. Situated within WHO's broader policy discourse on AI, the paper draws out how the foresight exercises strategically construct and validate particular trajectories aligned with WHO's existing priorities. Through selective narrative framing, expert input, and methodological design, WHO reinforces its epistemic authority by guiding the discourse on AI in global health toward context-sensitive and manageable use cases of the technology. Ultimately, these foresight exercises serve as a site of contestation, where competing visions of AI in global health are negotiated, and WHO's influence over future governance in the area is actively shaped.",

    "abstract": "The comprehensive identification of environmental and endogenous chemicals in human biospecimens is a critical bottleneck for realizing the Human Exposome Project. Untargeted metabolomics, particularly liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), offers unparalleled coverage of small molecules, but most detected features remain unidentified due to limited spectral libraries and structural ambiguity. Retention time (RT) prediction-based on quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRR) and enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI)-is an underutilized orthogonal parameter that can substantially improve metabolite annotation confidence. This review synthesizes advances in machine learning-based RT prediction, probabilistic calibration, and cross-platform harmonization for liquid chromatography and gas chromatography, including deep learning, graph neural networks, and transfer learning approaches. We evaluate workflows integrating RT prediction with mass-based searches and network-based annotation tools, highlighting their potential to refine candidate ranking and reduce false positives in environmental exposure assessment. The use of endogenous compounds as internal calibrants is discussed as a practical strategy for improving RT transferability across laboratories. We further outline how RT-aware annotation supports non-targeted screening of emerging contaminants, transformation products, and exposure biomarkers, thereby enhancing the interpretability and reproducibility of exposomics data. By integrating RT prediction, QSRR modeling, and AI into untargeted metabolomics pipelines, researchers can move from qualitative detection toward quantitative, inference-driven mapping of environmental influences on human health, strengthening the scientific foundation for environmental health policy and preventive public health strategies.",

While traditional models emphasize mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and proteostasis imbalance, emerging data highlight a neurogenic component involving motor neuron loss, fiber denervation, neuromuscular junction remodeling, and disrupted trophic signaling. To synthesize current evidence on neurogenic mechanisms of sarcopenia revealed by next-generation sequencing and related multi-omics, to map molecular networks across cell types, and to outline translational opportunities for diagnostics and targeted therapy. A narrative review of human and animal studies indexed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus through November 2025. Search terms combined sarcopenia, denervation, neuromuscular junction, neurotrophic signaling, genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics. Eligible studies reported omics or physiological endpoints related to neuromuscular function. Convergent omics data support a central role of the nervous system in the onset and progression of sarcopenia. Genetic and regulatory factors linked to denervation, transcriptomic signatures of junctional disassembly, and cell-specific dysfunctions in motor neurons, Schwann cells, satellite cells, and fibro-adipogenic progenitors have been identified. Epigenetic and transcriptional networks underlying neuromuscular homeostasis, along with candidate circulating biomarkers, provide targets for clinical translation. Neurogenic sarcopenia represents a tractable target for precision prevention and therapy. Integration of multi-omics, artificial intelligence, and advanced models such as innervated organoids and NMJ-on-chip systems can accelerate target validation and enable personalized strategies to preserve neuromuscular function.",

    "abstract": "Genomics has developed in step with progress in computing. As computational capabilities have grown, analyses have expanded from simple statistics to artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches within genomics. The decline in sequencing costs has led to the accumulation of diverse genomic datasets, rapidly accelerating AI for genomic analysis. AI models are now developed and applied across many functional domains, including the prediction of transcription factor binding sites, epigenetic elements, DNA methylation, and noncoding sequence functional annotation. With the maturation of architectures such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers, many genomic models now accommodate longer inputs, capture long-range context, and integrate complex multi-omics data, thereby steadily improving predictive accuracy. Moreover, the emergence of generative AI has enabled models that can simulate and design genomic sequences. The introduction of generative AI into genomics goes beyond inferring function to the capability of replicating functional genomes. These advances will help advance genome interpretation and accelerate our ability to chart and navigate the genomic landscape.",

It enhances diagnostic accuracy and consistency in endoscopic and histopathological analyses, with performance comparable to or exceeding non-experts. AI aids in standardizing assessments like EREFS and EoEHSS, identifies molecular phenotypes and novel biomarkers, and predicts treatment responses, facilitating precision medicine. However, challenges exist: \"black box\" issues demand explainable AI (XAI) for trust; validation in large, diverse cohorts, ensuring model generalization, and regulatory approval are crucial; data governance, privacy, and algorithmic integrity require attention. Future priorities include researching pediatric populations, improving treatment response prediction, and developing non-invasive monitoring tools.

    "abstract": "Patients recovering from stroke often struggle with their rehabilitation exercises at home, with personal therapists being both costly and potentially unavailable. Virtual rehabilitation programs may assist the patients by providing quantitative and qualitative feedback. The critical step for these automated systems is identifying and segmenting the performed activities for repetitions, making repetition counting an essential component. For this, an affordable, robust and generalized system is required. Previous works utilize expensive systems like Vicon and Kinect (discontinued), or require extensive training and are incapable of live counting. In this study, we propose a live repetition counter that works on RGB videos with Mediapipe, used for joint extraction. Also, we utilized action recognition (12 activities) using a lightweight transformer-based model. We employed a four-axis variance mechanism to monitor the motion across any arbitrary axis combined with the autocorrelation method to identify repetitions across random patterns. Our system was evaluated on a custom RGB dataset as well as the benchmark datasets UI-PRMD and KIMORE, achieving mean MAE values of 3.2733 and 1.4467, respectively, along with real-time validation through preliminary experiments. For activity recognition, the model achieved F1-score value up to 0.996. Relying solely on the RGB camera, our approach ensures practicality for home rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, remains a chronic management challenge despite the success of biological therapies such as infliximab. A major limitation is secondary loss of response, which affects a substantial proportion of patients and complicates long-term treatment strategies. Emerging technologies such as radiomics, which converts medical images into quantitative features, and artificial intelligence (AI), which integrates complex multimodal data, offer new opportunities to predict treatment response, monitor disease activity, and personalize therapy. By combining imaging-derived radiomic features with clinical and laboratory information, AI-driven models can provide early, actionable insights to guide therapeutic decisions. This editorial discusses the promise and limitations of these approaches, emphasizing how they can be integrated into clinical decision-making pathways. While challenges in standardization, validation, and clinician adoption remain, radiomics and AI represent important steps toward precision medicine, with the potential to improve outcomes and optimize care for patients with IBD.",

In this future workflow, diagnosis and preprocedural planning may be semiautomated and guided by an AI-driven multidisciplinary tumor board, outcome prediction analysis, noninvasive imaging biopsy, personalized therapeutics, and simulations. Ablations will include automatic segmentation, integrated registration, optimized device selection and trajectory prescription, robotic stereotaxy for large composite treatment volumes, AI response criteria, multimodality fusion, and iterative sphere packing to improve end-to-end procedural management. Additionally, AI virtual outcome prediction software will enable preplanning of robotic endovascular interventions with prescriptive maneuvers that minimize risk and time under anesthesia.

    "abstract": "Oncology clinical trials play a pivotal role in the development of new therapeutic options; however, their implementation remains an extremely costly and time-consuming process. Artificial intelligence can open new horizons in the design and conduct of clinical trials, particularly in early phases, where safety, dose planning, and patient recruitment efficiency are critical. This paper aims to explore the potential applications of artificial intelligence in various stages of early-phase oncology trials, including biostatistical design, patient enrollment, and quality assurance aspects. Based on case studies and examples from the literature, it can be concluded that artificial intelligence can assist with precise protocol design, shorten recruitment timelines, and improve predictive performance in dose planning and patient selection, thereby reducing the number of adverse events. At the same time, regulatory, ethical, and data protection challenges remain significant barriers to the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence. Integrating artificial intelligence into clinical trials requires not only technological but also strategic-level modernization, from the industrial companies and authorities as well. The reliable and validated application of artificial intelligence could represent a major advancement in clinical research, particularly in increasing the success rate of early-phase trials.

    "abstract": "Rectal cancer presents complex surgical challenges due to the confined pelvic anatomy. Robotic-assisted surgery has gained prominence for its enhanced precision, dexterity, and ergonomics compared to conventional laparoscopy. This bibliometric analysis examined 598 English-language publications from 2006 to 2025 indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace and VOS viewer were used to map global research trends, institutional networks, and author contributions. The United States, Japan, and China were identified as leading contributors, with Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo University of Science, and Cleveland Clinic among the top institutions. Yusuke Kinugasa, Akio Shiomi, and Hiroyasu Kagawa were the most prolific authors. Early research focused on technical feasibility and learning curves, while recent studies emphasize survival outcomes, risk stratification, and comparisons with open resection. Emerging themes include functional preservation, nerve-sparing techniques, and integration of artificial intelligence and intraoperative imaging. The field is evolving toward personalized, multidisciplinary care. Despite technological advances, broader adoption and stronger institutional collaboration remain essential to fully realize the potential of robotic rectal cancer surgery.",

    "abstract": "Cancer's staggering molecular heterogeneity demands innovative approaches beyond traditional single-omics methods. The integration of multi-omics data, spanning genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and radiomics, can improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy when accompanied by rigorous preprocessing and external validation; for example, recent integrated classifiers report AUCs around 0.81-0.87 for difficult early-detection tasks. This review synthesizes how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning and machine learning, bridges this gap by enabling scalable, non-linear integration of disparate omics layers into clinically actionable insights. We explore cutting-edge AI methodologies, including graph neural networks for biological network modeling, transformers for cross-modal fusion, and explainable AI (XAI) for transparent clinical decision support. Critical applications are highlighted, such as AI-driven therapy selection (e.g., predicting targeted therapy resistance), proteogenomic early detection, and radiogenomic non-invasive diagnostics. We further address translational challenges: data harmonization, batch correction, missing data imputation, and computational scalability. Emerging trends, federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, spatial/single-cell omics for microenvironment decoding, quantum computing, and patient-centric \"N-of-1\" models, signal a paradigm shift toward dynamic, personalized cancer management. Despite persistent hurdles in model generalizability, ethical equity, and regulatory alignment, AI-powered multi-omics integration promises to transform precision oncology from reactive population-based approaches to proactive, individualized care.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-based radiogenomics has emerged as a promising approach for precision medicine in lung cancer. By integrating medical imaging, genomics, and clinical data, radiogenomics enables non-invasive prediction of key oncogenic driver mutations, exploration of associations between imaging features and gene expression, and development of prognostic models in lung cancer management. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied to predict the mutation status of genes such as epidermal growth factor receptor and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, which are crucial for personalized treatment strategies. Radiogenomic studies have identified significant correlations between radiomic features and gene clusters, providing insights into tumor heterogeneity and biological pathways. Moreover, radiogenomics has shown potential in predicting treatment responses, recurrence, and overall survival in lung cancer patients. However, challenges remain in standardization, comprehensive validation, model interpretability, ethnic diversity, and the construction of multi-omics databases. With the advancement of artificial intelligence and the expansion of multimodal databases, future research should focus on solving these challenges to improve the clinical value and generalizability of radiogenomic models, thus playing a greater role in personalized medicine for cancer.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping neurology, offering opportunities to improve efficiency, expand access to care, and enhance clinical decision making. Yet, without deliberate safeguards, AI can perpetuate or exacerbate existing health disparities, especially for systemically marginalized populations. This article examines the dual potential of AI, as both a driver of innovation and a source of bias, in the context of neurologic care. Drawing on literature review, stakeholder consultations, and practical examples, we outline the risks of AI worsening health disparities stemming from biased data sets, nonrepresentative training populations, and opaque algorithms. We also highlight opportunities for AI to promote health equity, including early disease detection in underserved settings, language-access tools, improved clinical trial diversity, and targeted quality improvement interventions. We propose 3 guiding principles for the neurology community to ensure that AI serves as a driver of equity: (1) ensuring diverse perspectives and community engagement in AI development; (2) expanding AI education and training for neurologists; and (3) establishing ethical policy and governance mechanisms. These recommendations are intended for clinicians, researchers, educators, health system leaders, policymakers, and professional societies and provide actionable strategies to integrate equity into every stage of AI design, implementation, and oversight. By centering inclusion, transparency, and accountability, AI can be harnessed to improve equitable access to high-quality neurologic care and to address long-standing disparities in neurologic health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect nucleic acids at ever-lower detection limits is crucial in molecular science, enabling disease management to shift from reactive response to proactive prediction and personalized medicine. This review synthesizes the technological landscape, which is organized into three strategies. First, we examine amplification-dependent platforms, charting their evolution from the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to the absolute quantification of digital PCR (dPCR) and the rapid point-of-care utility of isothermal methods. Second, we explore amplification-free paradigms, where technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short-palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based diagnostics and nanopore sequencing achieve sensitivity through signal generation mechanisms that directly interrogate native target molecules. Finally, we detail the emergence of nanotechnology-based biosensors, which employ the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials to transduce molecular recognition events into measurable optical or electronic signals. The clinical and scientific translation of these platforms is very useful, enabling noninvasive cancer monitoring via liquid biopsy, real-time infectious disease surveillance, and the reconstruction of past ecosystems from trace environmental DNA. However, realizing the full potential of these technologies is contingent on overcoming significant translational hurdles. Critical challenges include the standardization of preanalytical workflows to ensure sample integrity and the engineering of fully integrated, cost-effective \"sample-in, answer-out\" systems suitable for widespread deployment. The future trajectory of the field points toward the convergence of these molecular tools with microfluidics, automation, and artificial intelligence, thus promoting decentralized and predictive healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric pneumonia (PP) remains an important topic in undergraduate medical education and offers a suitable framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in AI-assisted learning. We developed a 27 open-ended survey including five core domains of PP, such as diagnosis, etiology, diagnostics, treatment, and prevention. DeepSeek V3, Gemini 2.0, and ChatGPT-3.5, were each provided with identical reference materials. Two pediatric infectious disease specialists independently assessed responses using a structured 10-point rubric through Licert, which presents a custom evaluation tool. DeepSeek V3 achieved the highest mean score (9.9), outperforming ChatGPT-3.5 (7.7), and Gemini 2.0 (7.5) through all domains (p < 0.001). Moreover, it received a full score in 26 out of 27 questions (96.3%) and achieved an accuracy score of  ≥ 5. In addition, the highest performance appeared in higher-order reasoning areas, including age-specific etiology and imaging interpretation, with DeepSeek V3 outperforming others by up to 3.2 points. While all models demonstrated almost safety, the variability in content quality however highlights the necessity for careful platform selection. Therefore, future research should explore educational outcomes comparing AI-assisted and conventional learning approaches to better define the role of LLMs in medical education.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects more than 250 million people. It is a heterogeneous disease with a variety of symptoms, severity, and underlying mechanisms. Long term remission has been achieved for small subgroups of people with asthma treated with targeted biologic therapy. Accurately defining asthma subgroups is therefore of upmost importance for further reducing the prevalence of asthma. The rapid rise in technologies that enable profiling of a spectrum of analytes provides the opportunity to accurately classify asthma subtypes and to elucidate the underlying causes of disease. Combining these technologies with artificial intelligence will enable more accurate disease prediction, precision diagnoses, and personalised treatments. A major challenge is the prioritisation and effective implementation of these technologies in clinical practice.",

This review synthesizes recent advancements across molecular pathogenesis, precision diagnostics, and therapeutic innovations. Key findings reveal that PDRA pathophysiology involves pregnancy-induced hormonal fluctuations, extracellular matrix remodeling, and mechanical overloading, necessitating individualized management. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced ultrasonography achieves superior diagnostic accuracy (Dice score: 85.93%, r = 0.944 vs. manual measurements) over traditional methods, while minimally invasive techniques including laparoscopic \"Slim-Mesh\" repair demonstrate reduced recurrence rates (< 10%) and enhanced recovery compared to open surgery. Biomaterial integration (such as synthetic and bioabsorbable meshes) promotes anatomical reconstruction. Intelligent rehabilitation systems combining surface electromyography and wearable sensors improve inter-rectus distance (IRD) reduction through real-time biomechanical feedback. Critical challenges persist regarding the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, long-term outcome validation of emerging technologies (> 5-year follow-up gaps), and optimization of AI-driven predictive models. We propose a potential precision medicine framework that integrates dynamic imaging, molecular profiling, and patient-specific interventions to optimize functional recovery and address heterogeneity in PDRA management.",

This review synthesizes the current workflow-from image acquisition and segmentation to feature extraction and modeling-and emphasizes clinical use cases: triage when tissue is limited, risk stratification, therapy selection (including immunotherapy), and longitudinal monitoring. Despite promising results, clinical translation is constrained by non-standardized imaging/feature pipelines, limited multi-center validation and calibration, vulnerability to data leakage, and challenges in interpretability, uncertainty handling, and software and model governance. We advocate treating genomic burden-tumor mutational burden (TMB), intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), and copy-number alterations (CNA)-as first-class endpoints and covariates, and outline a pattern-aware framework for EGFR T790M to inform surveillance and treatment sequencing. We also provide a practical reporting checklist and a pitfall-to-remedy table to support reproducible, multi-center studies and regulatory-grade documentation. Radiogenomics is best viewed as a complement to biopsy rather than a replacement. Real-world impact now depends on harmonized protocols, leakage-free external validation, explainable and uncertainty-aware models, and integration with multi-omics decision support to deliver reliable, patient-centered lung cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Clinical documentation burden remains a significant challenge in healthcare, particularly in primary care settings. Artificial intelligence (AI) scribes have emerged as potential solutions, but their effectiveness compared to human documentation lacks robust evidence, especially in community general practice environments. Documentation quality is compared between four commercial AI scribes and human-generated notes using four standardised clinical scenarios from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners examination repository in simulated general practice consultations. Three experienced general practitioners, blinded to the source, assessed quality using a modified Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI-9). AI-generated notes outperformed human documentation across multiple quality domains. Top AI scribes scored a mean of 44.08/50 (SD = 3.32) vs. 37.42 (SD = 9.78) for humans, excelling in thoroughness (M = 4.92), accuracy (M = 4.67), and freedom from bias (M = 4.92). Inter-rater reliability was high for thoroughness (ICC = 0.879) and accuracy (ICC = 0.745), but lower for subjective areas like synthesis (ICC = 0.082). This study shows that AI scribes can outperform traditional documentation in simulated general practice. Successful implementation, however, depends on workflow integration and customisation. Standardised evaluation and balancing consistency with clinical context are key. Future research should explore real-world use, focusing on customisation and workflow impact.",

    "abstract": "Rice, a staple crop for billions, faces persistent threats from pests and pathogens jeopardizing global food security. Functional genomics and multi-omics approaches have revealed complex immune strategies in rice, including NLR receptor-mediated resistance, transcriptional regulation, and emerging roles of non-coding RNAs such as long noncoding RNAs, and circular RNAs. Novel mechanisms-such as effector-triggered autophagic degradation (e.g., BISP-BPH14) and circular RNA-derived defense peptides-highlight the multilayered nature of rice immune responses. However, field application of these findings is challenged by effector variability, incomplete understanding of signal crosstalk, and the trade-off between resistance and development. Many resistance loci are suppressed in susceptible backgrounds, indicating a pivotal role for epigenetic regulators and susceptibility genes. Moreover, synergistic haplotypes and resistance modules, rather than single genes, may underlie durable field resistance. Future priorities should include: (1) functional validation of resistance elements under agroecological variation; (2) dissection of resistance-susceptibility and hormone signaling crosstalk; and (3) haplotype-based trait assembly in breeding pipelines. Integrating artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology will accelerate the design of broad-spectrum immune receptors, multiplex CRISPR-based editing platforms, and climate-resilient cultivars. Embracing a systems-level strategy of \"smart sensing, dynamic regulation, and ecological equilibrium\" will enable precision management of rice pests and diseases, paving the way toward sustainable crop production.",

    "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an autoimmune prompted skin disorder, whose hallmarks include the unpredictable onset of hives and itch. Symptom duration typically exceed 6 weeks, and flares can occur for up to 5 years or longer if untreated, impacting potentially any area of the body. The absence of obvious triggers and the variation in onset frequency often delays formal diagnosis which on average is approximately 2 years from first presentation. Initial standard of care is the use of low through to higher strength antihistamines in the first instance, with eventual escalation to prescription anti-inflammatory agents and potentially biologics once patients are under managed care. The societal impacts of delays in diagnosis are marked, with data suggesting CSU impacts up to 1% of the population, primarily of working age and with twice the prevalence in women. Herein, we advocate for the deployment of smartphone imaging and generative artificial intelligence technology to improve detection and early management of CSU through integrated self-care approaches. Such approaches embodying the tenets of P4 personalized medicine could have sustained impact on the disease through awareness campaigns, reducing the burden on the dermatology community and facilitating earlier access to curative therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have enabled multi-modal systems to model and translate diverse information spaces. Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal Deep Learning model for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data, rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates good performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute the most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually transforming healthcare. However, despite its promised benefits, AI in healthcare also raises a number of ethical, legal and social concerns. Compliance by design (CbD) has been proposed as one way of addressing some of these concerns. In the context of healthcare, CbD efforts could focus on building compliance with existing clinical guidelines (CGs), given that they provide the best practices identified according to evidence-based medicine. In this paper we use the example of AI-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to theoretically examine whether medical AI tools could be designed to be inherently compliant with CGs, and implication for ethics and trust. We argue that AI-based CDSS systematically complying with CGs when applied to specific patient cases are not desirable, as CGs, despite their usefulness in guiding medical decision-making, are only recommendations on how to diagnose and treat medical conditions. We thus propose a new understanding of CbD for CGs as a sociotechnical program supported by AI that applies to the whole clinical decision-making process rather than just understanding CbD for CGs as a process located only within the AI tool. This implies taking into account emerging knowledge from actual clinical practices to put CGs in perspective, reflexivity from users regarding the information needed for decision-making, as well as a shift in the design culture, from AI as a stand-alone tool to AI as an in-situ service located within particular healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic zonation reflects the concept that hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells (NPCs) perform distinct metabolic functions, depending on their spatial localization along the porto-central axis. The maintenance of this fine-tuned organization is essential for liver homeostasis, and its disruption may contribute to liver diseases, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Fat overload perturbs zonal gene signatures, lipid handling and oxygen/metabolite gradients progressively leading to steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis and HCC, conditions in which the hepatic architecture is lost. Traditional approaches have provided valuable insights into zonation, although they lack the spatial resolution and mask the heterogeneity of NPCs. Thus, the premise of this review is to discuss how spatial omics can redefine our understanding of hepatic zonation by integrating tissue mapping with metabolic organization, specifically focusing on MASLD. The advent of spatial omics accelerates knowledge regarding MASLD pathophysiology, providing more informative insights into transcriptional/translational/lipidomic/metabolomics zone-specific perturbations. Emerging spatial genomics and epigenomics applications further expand this scenario, allowing for the capture of chromatin remodeling in situ. The integration of these state-of-the-art approaches, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI)-based analyses, is promising in the clinic, as it may provide novel zonal prognostic biomarkers and pave the way for precision-medicine strategies targeting zonal switching.",

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled abnormal cell growth, referred to as cancer, can result in tumors, other fatal disabilities, and immune system deterioration. Typically, the treatment procedure is longer and extremely expensive owing to its higher recurrence and death rates. Early and precise detection and assessment of cancer are significant for improving patient survival rates. Moreover, initial cancer detection makes the treatment simpler and improves the rate of recovery, leading to a lower mortality rate. Gene expression data plays an important part in cancer classification at the initial phase. Precise cancer classification is a challenging and complex task because of the high-dimensional nature of gene expression data, coupled with the small sample size. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have recently developed fundamental models utilizing AI methods to diagnose and predict cancer. These techniques now play a leading role in increasing the precision of survival predictions, cancer susceptibility, and recurrence. This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence-Based Multimodal Approach for Cancer Genomics Diagnosis Using Optimized Significant Feature Selection Technique (AIMACGD-SFST) model. The aim is to develop precise and effective techniques for cancer genomics analysis using advanced computational and analytical techniques. The preprocessing stage comprises min-max normalization, handling missing values, encoding target labels, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Furthermore, the AIMACGD-SFST model employs the coati optimization algorithm (COA) method for feature selection process to choose the related features from the dataset. Finally, the ensemble models, namely deep belief network (DBN), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and variational stacked autoencoder (VSAE) are employed for the classification process. The experimental validation of the AIMACGD-SFST approach is performed under three diverse datasets. The comparison study of the AIMACGD-SFST approach illustrated superior accuracy value of 97.06%, 99.07%, and 98.55% over existing models under diverse datasets.",

This has created at pressing demand for healthcare professionals to deepen their understanding and utilizing health data and its application in clinical decision-making. In response, a new master's program in personalized medicine has been launched across five universities in Denmark. This study, drawing on the sociology of expertise, investigates how educators and master's students in the program perceive and engage with the knowledge necessary for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into patient treatment and care. Our findings suggest a prevailing belief among educators in the potential of AI and big data to revolutionize healthcare by personalizing treatment options and improving diagnostic processes. Course participants generally acknowledged the ethical responsibility to leverage the vast amounts of data provided by patients to enhance treatment outcomes. However, some feared it might undermine the clinical insight they had gained through years of experience - insights they described as 'the art of medicine.' They navigated their agency and autonomy in the human-algorithm collaboration by framing algorithms as supportive additions to human judgment rather than replacements for it. In conclusion, this paper advocates for a more integrated approach that combines big data analysis with practical experience in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension (HTN) impacts approximately 1.28 billion individuals globally and poses a great burden of disease. The objectives of this study are to explore the role of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and artificial intelligence (AI) in the management of HTN. A thorough literature search was conducted across various databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science (WoS), and Medline to retrieve articles related to the role of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and AI in the precision medicine of HTN. Genes-including ACE, NOS3, ADD1, CYP11B2, NPPA, and NPPB-have a profound impact on blood pressure (BP) regulation in our body and polymorphism in these key genes can lead to HTN. Up or down-regulation of genes by epigenetic factors such as miRNA-155, miRNA-210, and miRNA-122 can significantly contribute to the development of HTN. These genetic and epigenetic factors can also be used as specific targets for gene editing and gene therapy for long-term management of HTN. However, the implementation of these techniques has not been possible in clinical settings due to lack of human studies and safety concerns related to unpredictable DNA alterations, nucleotide deletions, and loss of allele-specific chromosomes. Modulation of gut microbiome through oral supplements, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), and dietary interventions has emerged as one the most effective and safe techniques for managing HTN in human models. AI-based cutting-edge models have helped curate personalized diet plans based on an individual's unique microbiome, genomic information, and physiological conditions leading to a reduction in BMI, fat, BP, and heart rate while improving overall cardiac health and gut microbial diversity. Despite the significant advantages offered by AI-based medicine, ethical concerns-related to data privacy, bias, and discrimination-and ineffective models have led to limited integration of AI in precision medicine of HTN. The integration of genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and AI-based models can play a key role in improving the current landscape of precision medicine of HTN. These cutting-edge techniques can lead to a shift from the current one-size-fits all approach to more personalized treatment plan however further research in human models is needed to determine the safety and true efficacy of these techniques. Additionally, new AI-models need to be developed that address ethical concerns and are effective in real-world clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are revolutionizing brain cancer theranostics by enhancing drug delivery and diagnostic accuracy. This review examines AI-enhanced engineering strategies for developing intelligent nanocarriers that target glioblastoma and other metastatic central nervous system malignancies. AI encompasses several computational methods, including machine learning (ML) and its subset deep learning (DL). Here, ML algorithms learn design rules for nanocarriers, and DL networks intricate pattern recognition for tumor segmentation and adaptive release. These approaches enable stimuli-responsive nanocarriers to react to tumor microenvironmental signals (eg, pH, enzyme activity) and external stimuli (eg, ultrasound), optimizing targeted medication release while minimizing off-target effects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), in conjunction with AI, enhance tumor detection and segmentation, while the integration of multiomics data facilitates tailored treatment planning. Advanced technologies encompass transferrin-functionalized nanoparticles for traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and dual-stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems. Notwithstanding general progress, apprehensions surrounding batch variability and industrial scalability persist. This review also addresses ethical concerns and cost disparities associated with AI-based therapeutics. The primary development target areas are federated learning for data privacy, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for regulatory transparency, and quantum ML for molecular-scale optimization. This paper charts the course to patient-specific, scalable neuro-oncology nanomedicine through the convergence of computational modeling, intelligent materials, and advanced imaging modalities. These themes are explored in greater detail in the introduction, where we lay the groundwork for intelligent nanocarriers, their design with the help of AI, and the clinical need for diagnostics-therapeutics convergence in brain cancer.",

    "abstract": "The world is currently facing an unprecedented convergence of crises that threaten the core pillars of public health, scientific integrity, and social stability. These challenges are profoundly interconnected and have the potential to exacerbate global inequalities, jeopardize health security, and undermine the progress achieved through decades of international collaboration. Our viewpoint declaration, developed by 366 healthcare workers and scientists from 119 countries across six continents, highlights the urgent need for global solidarity and collective action to address these interconnected global health challenges. As healthcare workers and scientists, we must prioritize the protection of scientific integrity, combat political interference, and restore public trust in the scientific process. This will require a commitment to transparency, ethical responsibility, and evidence-based decision-making that can stand strong in the face of political and social adversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of resilient healthcare systems, emphasizing that preparedness, capacity building and coherent leadership and coordination are essential for future global health crises. In addition, our call for a One Health approach, acknowledging the intricate relationship between human, animal, and environmental health, has never been more pressing, especially as zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance spread across borders. As we confront ongoing wars, environmental destruction, and global persistent health inequalities, it is only through unity, solidarity, collaboration, and innovation that we hope to build a healthier, more equitable world. Together, we must ensure that science and medicine remain a force for good, capable of addressing both the immediate and long-term needs and challenges facing our shared future.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the accuracy and reliability of six large language models (LLMs)-three Chinese (Doubao, Kimi, DeepSeek) and three international (ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro, Grok3)-in radiology, using simulated questions from the 2025 Chinese Radiology Attending Physician Qualification Examination (CRAPQE). Analysis covered 400 CRAPQE-simulated questions, spanning various formats (A1, A2-A4, B, C-type) and modalities (text-only, image-based). Expert radiologists scored responses against official answer keys. Performance comparisons within and between Chinese and international LLM groups assessed overall, unit-specific, question-type-specific, and modality-specific accuracy. All LLMs passed the CRAPQE simulation, showing proficiency comparable to a radiology attending. Chinese LLMs achieved a higher mean accuracy (87.2%) than international LLMs (80.4%, P < 0.05), excelling in text-only and A1-type questions (P < 0.05). DeepSeek (91.6%) and Doubao (89.5%) outperformed Kimi (80.5%, P < 0.0167), while international LLMs showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). All models surpassed the passing threshold on image-based questions but performed worse than on text questions, with no group difference (P > 0.05). This pioneering comparison highlights the potential of LLMs in radiology, with Chinese models outperforming their international counterparts, likely due to localized training, providing evidence to guide the development of medical AI.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical workflows is advancing even before full compliance with the European Union Cross-Border eHealth Network (MyHealth@EU) framework is achieved. While AI-based clinical decision support systems are automatically classified as high risk under the European Union's AI Act, cross-border health data exchange must also satisfy MyHealth@EU interoperability requirements. This creates a dual-compliance challenge: vertical safety and ethics controls mandated by the AI Act and horizontal semantic transport requirements enforced through Open National Contact Point (OpenNCP) gateways, many of which are still maturing toward production readiness. This paper provides a practical, phase-oriented tutorial that enables developers and providers to embed AI Act safeguards before approaching MyHealth@EU interoperability tests. The goal is to show how AI-specific metadata can be included in the Health Level Seven International Clinical Document Architecture and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources messages without disrupting standard structures, ensuring both compliance and trustworthiness in AI-assisted clinical decisions. We systematically analyzed Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (AI Act) and the OpenNCP technical specifications, extracting a harmonized set of overlapping obligations. The AI Act provisions on transparency, provenance, and robustness are mapped directly onto MyHealth@EU workflows, identifying the points where outgoing messages must record AI involvement, log provenance, and trigger validation. To operationalize this mapping, we propose a minimal extension set, covering AI contribution status, rationale, risk classification, and Annex IV documentation links, together with a phase-based compliance checklist that aligns AI Act controls with MyHealth@EU conformance steps. A simulated International Patient Summary transmission demonstrates how Clinical Document Architecture/Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources extensions can annotate AI involvement, how OpenNCP processes such enriched payloads, and how clinicians in another member state view the result with backward compatibility preserved. We expand on security considerations (eg, Open Worldwide Application Security Project generative AI risks such as prompt injection and adversarial inputs), continuous postmarket risk assessment, monitoring, and alignment with MyHealth@EU's incident aggregation system. Limitations reflect the immaturity of current infrastructures and regulations, with real-world validation pending the rollout of key dependencies. AI-enabled clinical software succeeds only when AI Act safeguards and MyHealth@EU interoperability rules are engineered together from day 0. This tutorial provides developers with a forward-looking blueprint that reduces duplication of effort, streamlines conformance testing, and embeds compliance early. While the concept is still in its early phases of practice, it represents a necessary and worthwhile direction for ensuring that future AI-enabled clinical systems can meet both European Union regulatory requirements from day 1., risks such as prompt injection and adversarial inputs), continuous postmarket risk assessment, monitoring, and alignment with MyHealth@EU's incident aggregation system.

    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining attention in rheumatology, little is known about patient perspectives. This study addresses this gap by examining patients' experiences and attitudes toward AI. A nationwide, cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between March and May 2025 among adult patients with rheumatic diseases in Germany. Data were analyzed descriptively and with cluster analysis. A total of 778 patients completed the survey (70.4% female, mean age 51.3 years). The most common diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis (31.7%). While 26.8% reported current AI use for health-related purposes, 57.8% expressed interest in using it. Patients were particularly interested in AI-based symptom checkers (64.3%), therapy recommendations (50.6%), and chatbots for medical inquiries (44.5%). 57.6% of patients indicated that they would welcome their rheumatologists using AI-based clinical suppport. The most frequently cited benefits of AI included improved information access (63.5%) and faster diagnosis (57.7%), while concerns centered on faulty AI (74.3%) and reduced human interaction (59.6%). Cluster analysis identified three distinct patient profiles: 'AI-savvy' (41.4%), 'AI-pragmatic' (44.8%), and 'AI-skeptical' (13.8%). Cluster membership was significantly associated with age and education, with younger patients more often belonging to the 'AI-savvy' group. Patients with rheumatic diseases showed substantial interest in AI-supported care, although actual use in medical contexts remained limited. Age and education differences highlight the need for tailored implementation strategies to ensure equitable and patient-centered adoption of AI in rheumatology.",

    "abstract": "Future research on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins is essential for advancing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and control amid rising drug resistance and global health challenges. Recent studies focus on elucidating protein structures and interactions critical to bacterial survival, virulence, and drug resistance, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Cutting-edge technologies such as single-cell proteomics, cryo-electron microscopy, and spatial proteomics provide unprecedented resolution of protein localization, dynamics, and host-pathogen interactions. Posttranslational modifications and dynamic proteomic profiling reveal bacterial adaptive mechanisms, while integrative multi-omics combined with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning accelerate functional annotation and predictive modeling. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-based functional genomics complements these approaches by enabling precise gene regulation studies. Advances in AI-powered diagnostics and genomic surveillance are transforming TB detection and drug resistance profiling, improving patient outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Overall, integrating experimental and computational innovations promises to deepen understanding of Mtb biology, accelerate drug discovery, enhance diagnostics, and ultimately contribute to global efforts in combating tuberculosis.",

Consultation summary reports from the emergency department (ED) are critical for continuity of care and clinical decision-making. This study aims to evaluate the quality and utility of automatically generated neurological consultation reports with clear recommendations, while reducing neurologists' documentation burden. We used neurological consultation reports (n = 250) from the ED as reference outputs. For each case, we fed the report's constituent components into the large language model (LLM). Using prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate auto-summarized reports, which were then compared against the original consultation reports. The Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and semantic embedding (Clinical-BioBert) were used as performance metrics. The LLM-generated report exhibited high semantic similarity with the neurologist's report (0.89 ± 0.03). However, significant differences in report length were observed, with LLM-generated reports being more concise than those written by attending neurologists (61.56 vs. 94.75 words, p < 0.001). Additionally, LLM-generated reports were written in a more straightforward and accessible style (FKGL = 11.3 vs. 12.22, p < 0.001). Despite these strengths, the LLM-generated reports exhibited substantial divergence in writing style from neurologists' reports (ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.25, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.09, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.19). LLM-generated neurological consultation reports demonstrate strong semantic alignment with human-authored reports while offering a more concise and accessible format. Notable differences in writing style suggest a standardized approach that, while effective in conveying clinical content, may lack the personalization of neurologist-written reports.",

However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.",

Building on this progress, we reinterpret Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntRL) as a diffusion model-based sampling problem. We tackle this problem by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion policy and the optimal policy distribution using a tractable upper bound. By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO. All of these methods require only minor implementation changes to their base algorithm. We find that on standard continuous control benchmarks, DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO achieve better returns and higher sample efficiency than SAC and PPO.",

We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.",

However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\\% and reduces collisions by 54\\%.",

However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.",

Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning. While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.",

However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.",

    "abstract": "The training of deep vision models is fundamentally a signal recovery problem amidst high-dimensional stochastic noise. Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \\textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a \"low-bit\" exploration phase and a \"high-precision\" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning.",

Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.",

The framework models generation as a conflict between a 'Compression Pressure' - a drive to minimize overall codebook entropy - and a 'Diversity Pressure' - a drive to maximize conditional entropy given an input. We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: \"Diversity-Prioritized\" (MIM), \"Compression-Prioritized\" (AR), and \"Decoupled\" (Diffusion).

While human evaluation is reliable, it is slow and costly. Single LLM judges are biased, and static juries lack adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines. These results highlight the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains.",

    "abstract": "Randomized Smoothing (RS) is a prominent technique for certifying the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations. With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference. Moreover, it consistently outperforms prior input-dependent noise approaches across most radii, with particularly large gains at radii 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, achieving relative improvements of 19%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. On ImageNet, dual RS remains effective across all radii. Additionally, the dual RS framework naturally provides a routing perspective for certified robustness, improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off with off-the-shelf expert RS models.",

We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical end-to-end automation.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task of critical importance across numerous domains. Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.",

These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.",

    "abstract": "Legal AI systems powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face a critical accountability challenge: when an AI assistant cites case law, statutes, or contractual clauses, practitioners need verifiable guarantees that generated text faithfully represents source documents. Existing hallucination detectors rely on semantic similarity metrics that tolerate entity substitutions, a dangerous failure mode when confusing parties, dates, or legal provisions can have material consequences. We introduce HalluGraph, a graph-theoretic framework that quantifies hallucinations through structural alignment between knowledge graphs extracted from context, query, and response. Our approach produces bounded, interpretable metrics decomposed into \\textit{Entity Grounding} (EG), measuring whether entities in the response appear in source documents, and \\textit{Relation Preservation} (RP), verifying that asserted relationships are supported by context. On structured control documents, HalluGraph achieves near-perfect discrimination ($>$400 words, $>$20 entities), HalluGraph achieves $AUC = 0.979$, while maintaining robust performance ($AUC \\approx 0.89$) on challenging generative legal task, consistently outperforming semantic similarity baselines. The framework provides the transparency and traceability required for high-stakes legal applications, enabling full audit trails from generated assertions back to source passages.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the representations learned by large language models (LLMs) are partially aligned to those of the human brain. However, whether and why this alignment score arises from a similar sequence of computations remains elusive. In this study, we explore this question by examining temporally-resolved brain signals of participants listening to 10 hours of an audiobook. We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.",

We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.",

We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines.

Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet conventional CoT often exhibits internal determinism during decoding, limiting exploration of plausible alternatives. Recent methods attempt to address this by generating soft abstract tokens to enable reasoning in a continuous semantic space. However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns. Empirical results show that M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models trained with M3PO maintain interpretability and inference efficiency, underscoring the promise of multi-path collaborative learning for robust reasoning.",

Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs.

Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \\emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \\emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general. We demonstrate the effects predicted by our theory in a well-controlled simulation study.",

    "abstract": "Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.",

To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.",

Recent denoising diffusion decoders with transformer backbones achieve state-of-the-art performance, but their iterative sampling limits practicality in low-latency settings. We introduce the Error Correction Consistency Flow Model (ECCFM), an architecture-agnostic training framework for high-fidelity one-step decoding. By casting the reverse denoising process as a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) and enforcing smoothness through a differential time regularization, ECCFM learns to map noisy signals along the decoding trajectory directly to the original codeword in a single inference step. Across multiple decoding benchmarks, ECCFM attains lower bit-error rates (BER) than autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines, with notable improvements on longer codes, while delivering inference speeds up from 30x to 100x faster than denoising diffusion decoders.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.",

We demonstrated that the directed evolution algorithm is an effective strategy for uncertainty exploration, enhancing generalization in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, by incorporating replay buffer and continual backpropagate methods into DEM, we provide evidence of achieving better trade-off between exploitation and exploration in continuous learning settings.

    "abstract": "Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.   This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.   The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.   Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.",

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale in parameter count, deploying them on commodity hardware has become increasingly challenging. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable.   In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\\%) and SpQR (65.34\\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data.",

In this work, we extend NGU to multi-agent environments and evaluate its performance in the simple_tag environment from the PettingZoo suite. Compared to a multi-agent DQN baseline, NGU achieves moderately higher returns and more stable learning dynamics. We investigate three design choices: (1) shared replay buffer versus individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents using different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous values of the beta parameter. Our results show that NGU with a shared replay buffer yields the best performance and stability, highlighting that the gains come from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing. Novelty sharing performs comparably when k = 1 but degrades learning for larger values. Finally, heterogeneous beta values do not improve over a small common value. These findings suggest that NGU can be effectively applied in multi-agent settings when experiences are shared and intrinsic exploration signals are carefully tuned.",

    "abstract": "Large language model based agents are increasingly deployed in complex, tool augmented environments. While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn.

Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of flow matching remains limited, particularly in terms of sample complexity results. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the sample complexity for flow-matching based generative models without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) of the loss function for estimating the velocity field. Under standard assumptions on the loss function for velocity field estimation and boundedness of the data distribution, we show that a sufficiently expressive neural network can learn a velocity field such that with $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ samples, such that the Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and the true distribution is less than $\\mathcal{O}(ε)$. The key technical idea is to decompose the velocity field estimation error into neural-network approximation error, statistical error due to the finite sample size, and optimization error due to the finite number of optimization steps for estimating the velocity field. Each of these terms are then handled via techniques that may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on challenging tasks by generating elaborate chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth.   To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup.",

    "abstract": "Current benchmarks for evaluating the chemical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by oversimplified tasks, lack of process-level evaluation, and misalignment with expert-level chemistry skills. To address these issues, we introduce SUPERChem, a benchmark of 500 expert-curated reasoning-intensive chemistry problems, covering diverse subfields and provided in both multimodal and text-only formats. Original content and an iterative curation pipeline eliminate flawed items and mitigate data contamination. Each problem is paired with an expert-authored solution path, enabling Reasoning Path Fidelity (RPF) scoring to evaluate reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy. Evaluations against a human baseline of 40.3% accuracy show that even the best-performing model, GPT-5 (High), reaches only 38.5%, followed closely by Gemini 2.5 Pro (37.9%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think (37.3%). SUPERChem elicits multi-step, multimodal reasoning, reveals model-dependent effects of visual information, and distinguishes high-fidelity reasoners from heuristic ones. By providing a challenging benchmark and a reliable evaluation framework, SUPERChem aims to facilitate the advancement of LLMs toward expert-level chemical intelligence.

    "abstract": "Traditional data sources on bushfire evacuation behaviour, such as quantitative surveys and manual observations have severe limitations. Mining social media data related to bushfire evacuations promises to close this gap by allowing the collection and processing of a large amount of behavioural data, which are low-cost, accurate, possibly including location information and rich contextual information. However, social media data have many limitations, such as being scattered, incomplete, informal, etc. Together, these limitations represent several challenges to their usefulness to better understand bushfire evacuation. To overcome these challenges and provide guidance on which and how social media data can be used, this scoping review of the literature reports on recent advances in relevant data mining techniques. In addition, future applications and open problems are discussed. We envision future applications such as evacuation model calibration and validation, emergency communication, personalised evacuation training, and resource allocation for evacuation preparedness. We identify open problems such as data quality, bias and representativeness, geolocation accuracy, contextual understanding, crisis-specific lexicon and semantics, and multimodal data interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and planning, aiming to minimize generation costs while satisfying physical constraints such as power flow equations, generator limits, and voltage limits. Traditional OPF solving methods typically employ iterative optimization algorithms (such as interior point methods, sequential quadratic programming, etc.), with limitations including low computational efficiency, initial value sensitivity, and low batch computation efficiency. Most existing deep learning-based OPF methods rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving large numbers of cases, and have difficulty guaranteeing physical consistency. This paper proposes an Optimal Power Flow solving method based on neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow, transforming OPF problems into energy minimization problems. By constructing an energy function to measure the degree of deviation from the constraint manifold, and guiding networks to learn optimal solutions that simultaneously satisfy power flow constraints and minimize costs through gradient flow. Neural networks are trained unsupervised by directly minimizing physical residuals, requiring no labeled data, achieving true \"end-to-end\" physics-constrained learning.",

    "abstract": "Standard Transformers suffer from a \"Semantic Alignment Tax\", a prohibitive optimization cost required to organize a chaotic initialization into a coherent geometric map via local gradient diffusion. We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates \"Catastrophic Rigidity\", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the \"Plasticity-Stability\" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU). These results suggest that harmonic representations effectively decouple memory from reasoning, offering a structural solution to the plasticity-stability dilemma in real-time knowledge adaptation.",

The simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can both transmit and reflect signals, enabling comprehensive signal control and expanding application scenarios. This paper introduces an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to further enhance system flexibility and proposes an optimization design for the spectrum efficiency of the STAR-RIS-UAV-assisted wireless communication system. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm capable of iteratively optimizing beamforming, phase shifts, and UAV positioning to maximize the system's sum rate through continuous interactions with the environment. To improve exploration in deterministic policies, we introduce a stochastic perturbation factor, which enhances exploration capabilities. As exploration is strengthened, the algorithm's ability to accurately evaluate the state-action value function becomes critical. Thus, based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we propose a convolution-augmented deep deterministic policy gradient (CA-DDPG) algorithm that balances exploration and evaluation to improve the system's sum rate. The simulation results demonstrate that the CA-DDPG algorithm effectively interacts with the environment, optimizing the beamforming matrix, phase shift matrix, and UAV location, thereby improving system capacity and achieving better performance than other algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the brain responds to external stimuli and decoding this process has been a significant challenge in neuroscience. While previous studies typically concentrated on brain-to-image and brain-to-language reconstruction, our work strives to reconstruct gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by brain. Unfortunately, the lack of paired \\{brain, speech, gesture\\} data hinders the deployment of deep learning models for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, \\textbf{fMRI2GES}, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using \\textbf{Dual Brain Decoding Alignment}. This method relies on two key components: (i) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and (ii) textual descriptions associated with the gestures. Then, instead of training models in a completely supervised manner to find a mapping relationship among the three modalities, we harness an fMRI-to-text model, a text-to-gesture model with paired data and an fMRI-to-gesture model with unpaired data, establishing dual fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction patterns. Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings. We also investigate fMRI signals from different ROIs in the cortex and how they affect generation results. Overall, we provide new insights into decoding co-speech gestures, thereby advancing our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science.",

    "abstract": "A robot's instantaneous sensory observations do not always reveal task-relevant state information. Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to \"privileged\" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a \"generalist\" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

We introduce Counter-Example-Driven Curricula (CEDC), an automated framework that improves model robustness by iteratively focusing on its own failures. At each step, CEDC uses the current model to generate a diverse set of candidate problems, employs a fast, executable verifier to identify incorrect predictions (counter-examples), and then fine-tunes the model on a dataset enriched with these discovered failures. We evaluate CEDC on a suite of algorithmic and natural language tasks, including integer addition, sorting, Dyck-2 language recognition, and three text classification benchmarks. Compared to static training and standard curriculum learning baselines, CEDC achieves up to 30x greater length extrapolation, is 3.75x more computationally efficient than uniform data augmentation, and requires no manual difficulty heuristics. We provide a detailed analysis of the counter-examples, showing how the curriculum naturally adapts to target progressively more complex error modes. Our findings establish verifier-guided, failure-driven learning as a simple, powerful, and efficient paradigm for enhancing the generalization capabilities of Transformer models.",

    "abstract": "Conversion and conversion rate (CVR) prediction play a critical role in efficient advertising decision-making. In past decades, although researchers have developed plenty of models for CVR prediction, the methodological evolution and relationships between different techniques have been precluded. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on CVR prediction in online advertising, and classify state-of-the-art CVR prediction models into six categories with respect to the underlying techniques and elaborate on connections between these techniques. For each category of models, we present the framework of underlying techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and discuss how they are utilized for CVR prediction. Moreover, we summarize the performance of various CVR prediction models on public and proprietary datasets. Finally, we identify research trends, major challenges, and promising future directions. We observe that results of performance evaluation reported in prior studies are not unanimous; semantics-enriched, attribution-enhanced, debiased CVR prediction and jointly modeling CTR and CVR prediction would be promising directions to explore in the future. This review is expected to provide valuable references and insights for future researchers and practitioners in this area.",

    "abstract": "The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.",

A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations. This work highlights the feasibility of lightweight, on-device RL for energy-efficient lighting control and sets the groundwork for multi-modal environmental control applications in resource-constrained agricultural systems.",

    "abstract": "Thermal analysis is increasingly critical in modern integrated circuits, where non-uniform power dissipation and high transistor densities can cause rapid temperature spikes and reliability concerns. Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71°C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85°C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55°C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95°C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(Δt) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(Δt^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.",

Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \\emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \\ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \\ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data. The results show that \\ours{} significantly outperforms existing open-set recognition methods under background shift. Moreover, we provide new insights into how factors such as the size of the novel class influences performance, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior work.",

Conventional machine learning approaches typically optimize statistical accuracy metrics that do not reflect this operational reality and cannot reliably distinguish causal relationships from spurious correlations. This study evaluates eight predictive models, ranging from baseline statistical approaches to formal causal inference methods, on a dataset of 10,000 CNC machines with a 3.3% failure prevalence. The formal causal inference model (L5) achieved estimated annual cost savings of 1.16 million USD (a 70.2 percent reduction), outperforming the best correlation-based decision tree model (L3) by approximately 80,000 USD per year. The causal model matched the highest observed recall (87.9 percent) while reducing false alarms by 97 percent (from 165 to 5) and attained a precision of 92.1 percent, with a train-test performance gap of only 2.6 percentage points. These results indicate that causal AI methods, when combined with domain knowledge, can yield superior financial outcomes and more interpretable predictions compared to correlation-based approaches in predictive maintenance applications.",

ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k. We further show that gradient clustering enables ModC without explicit mode labels, yielding up to 10% gains on datasets such as NuminaMath. Finally, we show that ModC improves reinforcement learning (RL) and can further boost diversity-inducing RL methods. These results demonstrate that standard training underutilizes the diversity in data, and that ModC provides a simple, effective remedy for unlocking the full benefits of diversity in test-time scaling.",

While robust training can reduce sensitivity to some forms of noise, it is infeasible to anticipate all possible OOD conditions. To mitigate this issue, we develop an algorithm that leverages a world model's inherent measure of surprise to reduce the impact of noise in world model--based reinforcement learning agents. We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor. While the introduction of noise typically degrades agent performance, we show that our techniques preserve performance relative to baselines under varying types and levels of noise across multiple environments within self-driving simulation domains (CARLA and Safety Gymnasium). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods enhance the stability of two state-of-the-art world models with markedly different underlying architectures: Cosmos and DreamerV3.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together.   We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs.   We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\\times$ reduction in runtime.",

This paper introduces the idea of a foundation prior, which shows that model-generated outputs are not as real observations, but draws from the foundation prior induced prior predictive distribution. As such synthetic data reflects both the model's learned patterns and the user's subjective priors, expectations, and biases. We model the subjectivity of the generative process by making explicit the dependence of synthetic outputs on the user's anticipated data distribution, the prompt-engineering process, and the trust placed in the foundation model.   We derive the foundation prior as an exponential-tilted, generalized Bayesian update of the user's primitive prior, where a trust parameter governs the weight assigned to synthetic data. We then show how synthetic data and the associated foundation prior can be incorporated into standard statistical and econometric workflows, and discuss their use in applications such as refining complex models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient and partially linear specifications. By treating generative outputs as structured, explicitly subjective priors rather than as empirical observations, the framework offers a principled way to harness foundation models in empirical work while avoiding the conflation of synthetic ''facts'' with real data.",

From the generative perspective, Smart Bayes relaxes the fixed unit weights of Naive Bayes by allowing data-driven coefficients on density-ratio features. From a discriminative perspective, it constructs transformed inputs as marginal log-density ratios that explicitly quantify how much more likely each feature value is under one class than another, thereby providing predictors with stronger class separation than the raw covariates. To support this framework, we develop a spline-based estimator for univariate log-density ratios that is flexible, robust, and computationally efficient. Through extensive simulations and real-data studies, Smart Bayes often outperforms both logistic regression and Naive Bayes.

    "abstract": "We present CycliST, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Video Language Models (VLM) on their ability for textual reasoning over cyclical state transitions. CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks. By providing a targeted challenge and a comprehensive evaluation framework, CycliST paves the way for visual reasoning models that surpass the state-of-the-art in understanding periodic patterns.",

I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated material discovery increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning, collectively termed \"AI/ML\". A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community. This work provides a road map for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that will accurately and confidently enable material discovery.",

Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment.",

Then, we use a generative model to convert satellite images to radar images, which are used for precipitation nowcasting. Compared to baseline models, our proposed model shows a notable improvement in moderate (4mm/h) precipitation event prediction alongside short-term heavy (8mm/h) precipitation event prediction.

Focusing on ViT-B/16 trained on ImageNet-1K, we study two simple parameter-reduction strategies applied to the MLP blocks, each removing 32.7\\% of the baseline parameters. Our \\emph{GroupedMLP} variant shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks and achieves 81.47\\% top-1 accuracy while maintaining the baseline computational cost. Our \\emph{ShallowMLP} variant halves the MLP hidden dimension and reaches 81.25\\% top-1 accuracy with a 38\\% increase in inference throughput. Both models outperform the 86.6M-parameter baseline (81.05\\%) and exhibit substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47\\% to the range 0.03\\% to 0.06\\%. These results suggest that, for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K with a standard training recipe, the model operates in an overparameterized regime in which MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance and can even slightly improve it. More broadly, our findings suggest that architectural constraints such as parameter sharing and reduced width may act as useful inductive biases, and highlight the importance of how parameters are allocated when designing Vision Transformers.

    "abstract": "Machine Unlearning is essential for large generative models (VAEs, DDPMs) to comply with the right to be forgotten and prevent undesired content generation without costly retraining. Existing approaches, such as Static-lambda SISS for diffusion models, rely on a fixed mixing weight lambda, which is suboptimal because the required unlearning strength varies across samples and training stages.   We propose Adaptive-lambda SISS, a principled extension that turns lambda into a latent variable dynamically inferred at each training step. A lightweight inference network parameterizes an adaptive posterior over lambda, conditioned on contextual features derived from the instantaneous SISS loss terms (retain/forget losses and their gradients). This enables joint optimization of the diffusion model and the lambda-inference mechanism via a variational objective, yielding significantly better trade-offs.   We further extend the adaptive-lambda principle to score-based unlearning and introduce a multi-class variant of Score Forgetting Distillation. In addition, we present two new directions: (i) a hybrid objective combining the data-free efficiency of Score Forgetting Distillation with the direct gradient control of SISS, and (ii) a Reinforcement Learning formulation that treats unlearning as a sequential decision process, learning an optimal policy over a state space defined by the model's current memory of the forget set.   Experiments on an augmented MNIST benchmark show that Adaptive-lambda SISS substantially outperforms the original static-lambda SISS, achieving stronger removal of forgotten classes while better preserving generation quality on the retain set.",

However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \\textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \\textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \\textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \\textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \\textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for optimizing decision-making in complex systems under uncertainty, an essential challenge in real-world settings, particularly in the context of the energy transition. A representative example is remote microgrids that supply power to communities disconnected from the main grid. Enabling the energy transition in such systems requires coordinated control of renewable sources like wind turbines, alongside fuel generators and batteries, to meet demand while minimizing fuel consumption and battery degradation under exogenous and intermittent load and wind conditions. These systems must often conform to extensive regulations and complex operational constraints. To ensure that RL agents respect these constraints, it is crucial to provide interpretable guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Shielded Controller Units (SCUs), a systematic and interpretable approach that leverages prior knowledge of system dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction. Our shield synthesis methodology, designed for real-world deployment, decomposes the environment into a hierarchical structure where each SCU explicitly manages a subset of constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCUs on a remote microgrid optimization task with strict operational requirements. The RL agent, equipped with SCUs, achieves a 24% reduction in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation, outperforming other baselines while satisfying all constraints. We hope SCUs contribute to the safe application of RL to the many decision-making challenges linked to the energy transition.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks have shown remarkable success in supervised learning when trained on a single task using a fixed dataset. However, when neural networks are trained on a reinforcement learning task, their ability to continue learning from new experiences declines over time. This decline in learning ability is known as plasticity loss. To restore plasticity, prior work has explored periodically resetting the parameters of the learning network, a strategy that often improves overall performance. However, such resets come at the cost of a temporary drop in performance, which can be dangerous in real-world settings. To overcome this instability, we introduce AltNet, a reset-based approach that restores plasticity without performance degradation by leveraging twin networks. The use of twin networks anchors performance during resets through a mechanism that allows networks to periodically alternate roles: one network learns as it acts in the environment, while the other learns off-policy from the active network's interactions and a replay buffer. At fixed intervals, the active network is reset and the passive network, having learned from prior experiences, becomes the new active network. AltNet restores plasticity, improving sample efficiency and achieving higher performance, while avoiding performance drops that pose risks in safety-critical settings. We demonstrate these advantages in several high-dimensional control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where AltNet outperforms various relevant baseline methods, as well as state-of-the-art reset-based techniques.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are becoming increasingly capable across diverse robotic tasks. However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

    "abstract": "Federated learning must address heterogeneity, strict communication and computation limits, and privacy while ensuring performance. We propose an operator-theoretic framework that maps the $L^2$-optimal solution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a forward operator, approximates it using available data, and maps back with the inverse operator, yielding a gradient-free scheme. Finite-sample bounds are derived using concentration inequalities over operator norms, and the framework identifies a data-dependent hypothesis space with guarantees on risk, error, robustness, and approximation. Within this space we design efficient kernel machines leveraging the space folding property of Kernel Affine Hull Machines. Clients transfer knowledge via a scalar space folding measure, reducing communication and enabling a simple differentially private protocol: summaries are computed from noise-perturbed data matrices in one step, avoiding per-round clipping and privacy accounting. The induced global rule requires only integer minimum and equality-comparison operations per test point, making it compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Across four benchmarks, the gradient-free FL method with fixed encoder embeddings matches or outperforms strong gradient-based fine-tuning, with gains up to 23.7 points. In differentially private experiments, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy loss in high-privacy regimes. The global rule admits an FHE realization using $Q \\times C$ encrypted minimum and $C$ equality-comparison operations per test point, with operation-level benchmarks showing practical latencies. Overall, the framework provides provable guarantees with low communication, supports private knowledge transfer via scalar summaries, and yields an FHE-compatible prediction rule offering a mathematically grounded alternative to gradient-based federated learning under heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Agentic large language models are proposed as autonomous code generators for scientific computing, yet their reliability in high-stakes problems remains unclear. Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.",

Although they are frequently applied independently or sequentially to cluster observations, the relationship between them, especially when K-means is used to cluster variables rather than observations, has been scarcely explored. This study seeks to address this gap by proposing an innovative method that analyzes the relationship between clusters of variables obtained by applying K-means on transposed data and the principal components of PCA. Our approach involves applying PCA to the original data and K-means to the transposed data set, where the original variables are converted into observations. The contribution of each variable cluster to each principal component is then quantified using measures based on variable loadings. This process provides a tool to explore and understand the clustering of variables and how such clusters contribute to the principal dimensions of variation identified by PCA.",

    "abstract": "For patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy, the time between clinic visits is full of uncertainties and risks of unmonitored side effects. To bridge this gap in care, we developed and prospectively trialed a multi-modal AI framework for remote patient monitoring (RPM). This system integrates multi-modal data from the HALO-X platform, such as demographics, wearable sensors, daily surveys, and clinical events. Our observational trial is one of the largest of its kind and has collected over 2.1 million data points (6,080 patient-days) of monitoring from 84 patients. We developed and adapted a multi-modal AI model to handle the asynchronous and incomplete nature of real-world RPM data, forecasting a continuous risk of future adverse events. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.9% (AUROC=0.70). Notably, the model identified previous treatments, wellness check-ins, and daily maximum heart rate as key predictive features. A case study demonstrated the model's ability to provide early warnings by outputting escalating risk profiles prior to the event. This work establishes the feasibility of multi-modal AI RPM for cancer care and offers a path toward more proactive patient support.(Accepted at Europe NeurIPS 2025 Multimodal Representation Learning for Healthcare Workshop)",

    "abstract": "Transformer models have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance in English. However, their effectiveness in Arabic, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER), remains limited, even with larger pre-trained models. This performance gap stems from multiple factors, including tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies. Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.   We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.   The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the \"what,\" \"how,\" and \"why\" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors. DeformAr is the first Arabic-specific, component-based interpretability tool, offering a crucial resource for advancing model analysis in under-resourced languages.",

We curated a scientifically rigorous dataset comprising 97 micro-CT scanned specimens across 27 species, selecting 12 species with sufficient representation for robust machine learning. To ensure methodological integrity and prevent data leakage, we employed specimen-level data splitting, resulting in 109,617 high-quality 2D slices (44,103 for training, 14,046 for validation, and 51,468 for testing). We evaluated seven state-of-the-art 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using transfer learning. Our final ensemble model, combining ConvNeXt-Large and EfficientNetV2-Small, achieved a test accuracy of 95.64%, with a top-3 accuracy of 99.6% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.998 across all species. To facilitate practical deployment, we developed an interactive advanced dashboard that supports real-time slice classification and 3D slice matching using advanced similarity metrics, including SSIM, NCC, and the Dice coefficient.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. Recent work studies RLVR through token entropy, arguing that high-entropy tokens drive exploration and should receive stronger updates. However, they overlook the fact that most of a reasoning trajectory consists of low-entropy segments that encode stable and reusable structural patterns. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that the overlap of low-entropy segments across correct responses strongly correlates with model accuracy, while overlaps involving incorrect responses exhibit stable but unproductive patterns. Motivated by these findings, we propose LESS, a correctness-aware reinforcement framework that performs fine-grained advantage modulation over low-entropy segments. LESS amplifies segments unique to correct responses, suppresses those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizes segments shared by both, while preserving high-entropy exploration in the underlying RL algorithm. Instantiated on top of the popular GRPO, LESS consistently improves accuracy over strong RL baselines across three backbones and six math benchmarks, achieves stronger robustness of the performance floor.",

Two open FMs (TabPFN-1.0 and TabICL-base) are compared against tuned XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest baselines on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU. The tree ensembles equal or surpass FM accuracy on three datasets while completing full-test batches in <= 0.40 s and <= 150 MB RAM, using zero VRAM. TabICL achieves a 0.8 percentage-point gain on Higgs but requires roughly 40,000 times more latency (960 s) and 9 GB VRAM. TabPFN matches tree-model accuracy on Wine and Housing but peaks at 4 GB VRAM and cannot process the full 100k-row Higgs table.

Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve. To ensure scalability, we develop an efficient approximation of Semantic Shift that replaces costly SVD computations, achieving a 15~30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Extensive evaluations across six real-world text and image datasets show that SFSes outperform standard classifiers not only in classification but also in nuanced tasks such as political bias detection, while SAFARI consistently reveals interpretable and generalizable semantic hierarchies.

    "abstract": "Clustering non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data under local differential privacy (LDP) in federated settings presents a critical challenge: preserving privacy while maintaining accuracy without iterative communication. Existing one-shot methods rely on unstable pairwise centroid distances or neighborhood rankings, degrading severely under strong LDP noise and data heterogeneity. We present Gravitational Federated Clustering (GFC), a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated clustering that overcomes the limitations of distance-based methods under varying LDP. Addressing the critical challenge of clustering non-IID data with diverse privacy guarantees, GFC transforms privatized client centroids into a global gravitational potential field where true cluster centers emerge as topologically persistent singularities. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a client-side compactness-aware perturbation mechanism that encodes local cluster geometry as \"mass\" values, and (2) a server-side topological aggregation phase that extracts stable centroids through persistent homology analysis of the potential field's superlevel sets. Theoretically, we establish a closed-form bound between the privacy budget $ε$ and centroid estimation error, proving the potential field's Lipschitz smoothing properties exponentially suppress noise in high-density regions. Empirically, GFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmarks, especially under strong LDP constraints ($ε< 1$), while maintaining comparable performance at lower privacy budgets. By reformulating federated clustering as a topological persistence problem in a synthetic physics-inspired space, GFC achieves unprecedented privacy-accuracy trade-offs without iterative communication, providing a new perspective for privacy-preserving distributed learning.",

In this work, we focus on a fundamental one: Is it always optimal for the training distribution to be identical to the test distribution? Surprisingly, assuming the existence of one-way functions, we find that the answer is no. That is, matching distributions is not always the best scenario, which contrasts with the behavior of most learning methods. Nonetheless, we also show that when certain regularities are imposed on the target functions, the standard conclusion is recovered in the case of the uniform distribution.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive optimization methods (such as Adam) play a major role in LLM pretraining, significantly outperforming Gradient Descent (GD). Recent studies have proposed new smoothness assumptions on the loss function to explain the advantages of adaptive algorithms with structured preconditioners, e.g., coordinate-wise or layer-wise, and steepest descent methods w.r.t. non-euclidean norms, e.g., $\\ell_\\infty$ norm or spectral norm, over GD. However, it remains unclear how these smoothness assumptions manifest in language modelling tasks. In this work, we aim to analyze the benefit of $\\ell_\\infty$-norm descent (a.k.a. sign descent) directly from properties of the data distribution, namely, heavy-tailed class imbalance. We propose a minimal yet representative setting of next-token prediction, where we can provably show faster convergence of coordinate-wise algorithms such as Sign descent (steepest descent w.r.t. $\\ell_\\infty$ norm) over normalized GD (steepest descent w.r.t. to $\\ell_2$ norm) in the presence of heavy tail class imbalance.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a neural network filter method based on contraction operators to address model collapse in recursive training of generative models. Unlike \\cite{xu2024probabilistic}, which requires superlinear sample growth ($O(t^{1+s})$), our approach completely eliminates the dependence on increasing sample sizes within an unbiased estimation framework by designing a neural filter that learns to satisfy contraction conditions. We develop specialized neural network architectures and loss functions that enable the filter to actively learn contraction conditions satisfying Assumption 2.3 in exponential family distributions, thereby ensuring practical application of our theoretical results. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when the learned contraction conditions are satisfied, estimation errors converge probabilistically even with constant sample sizes, i.e., $\\limsup_{t\\to\\infty}\\mathbb{P}(\\|\\mathbf{e}_t\\|>δ)=0$ for any $δ>0$. Experimental results show that our neural network filter effectively learns contraction conditions and prevents model collapse under fixed sample size settings, providing an end-to-end solution for practical applications.",

We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans. These findings highlight challenges MLLMs face in developing robust spatial representations from sequential visual input. Consequently, REM provides targeted metrics and diagnostics to foster improved spatial understanding in future models.",

For individual wind farms with integrated energy storage capacity, data-driven dispatch strategies using localized grid demand and market conditions as input parameters stand to maximize wind energy value. Synthetic power generation data modeled on atmospheric conditions provide another avenue for improving the robustness of data-driven dispatch strategies. To these ends, the present work develops two deep learning frameworks: COVE-NN, an LSTM-based dispatch strategy tailored to individual wind farms, which reduced annual COVE by 32.3% over 43 years of simulated operations in a case study at the Pyron site; and a power generation modeling framework that reduced RMSE by 9.5% and improved power curve similarity by 18.9% when validated on the Palouse wind farm. Together, these models pave the way for more robust, data-driven dispatch strategies and potential extensions to other renewable energy systems.",

    "abstract": "Covariate distribution shift occurs when certain structural features present in the test set are absent from the training set. It is a common type of out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, frequently encountered in real-world graph data with complex structures. Existing research has revealed that most out-of-the-box graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to account for covariate shifts. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods aimed at addressing covariate shifts often fail to fully leverage the rich information contained within the latent space. Motivated by the potential of the latent space, we introduce a new method called MPAIACL for More Powerful Adversarial Invariant Augmentation using Contrastive Learning. MPAIACL leverages contrastive learning to unlock the full potential of vector representations by harnessing their intrinsic information. Through extensive experiments, MPAIACL demonstrates its robust generalization and effectiveness, as it performs well compared with other baselines across various public OOD datasets.

    "abstract": "Cellular signaling networks represent complex information processing systems that have been modeled via traditional mathematical or statistical approaches. However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs provide a powerful paradigm for systems biology that advances precision medicine applications and therapeutic discovery in the era of AI.",

    "abstract": "The development of autonomous machine learning (ML) agents capable of end-to-end data science workflows represents a significant frontier in artificial intelligence. These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges. We believe our work provides a foundation for developing more capable tool-augmented planning ML agents.",
