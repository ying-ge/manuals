Background: Radiology report generation remains time-intensive, and diagnostic accuracy varies across expertise levels.
We developed a multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrating visual and textual information for automated 
radiology report generation with clinical decision support.

Methods: We trained GPT-4V-based architecture on 450,000 paired chest X-rays and reports from 120 hospitals across 
three continents (2020-2024). The model processes DICOM images and patient history to generate structured reports 
following the ACR standardized template. We incorporated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to reference similar 
historical cases and current clinical guidelines. The system was evaluated against 50 board-certified radiologists 
on 5,000 test cases using BLEU-4, clinical accuracy metrics, and time-to-diagnosis measurements.

Results: The MLLM achieved 0.89 BLEU-4 score for report quality, with 94.2% accuracy for critical findings detection 
(95% CI: 93.1-95.3), compared to 92.8% for junior radiologists and 96.1% for senior radiologists. Sensitivity for 
pneumothorax was 96.7%, specificity 98.2%. The model reduced average report generation time from 8.3 minutes to 
45 seconds while maintaining comparable accuracy. In a prospective clinical trial across 15 emergency departments, 
AI-assisted reporting reduced door-to-diagnosis time by 42% and improved inter-reader agreement (kappa 0.91 vs 0.78).

Conclusions: Multimodal LLMs can generate high-quality radiology reports approaching senior radiologist performance, 
with potential to improve clinical workflow efficiency and diagnostic consistency in resource-limited settings.

Objective: To validate AlphaFold 3's protein structure predictions in a real-world drug discovery pipeline and 
assess its impact on hit-to-lead optimization timelines.

Methods: We integrated AlphaFold 3 into our structure-based drug design workflow for three therapeutic targets: 
KRAS G12C (oncology), PCSK9 (cardiovascular), and SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The foundation model predicted 
protein-ligand complexes for 2,847 compounds, which were validated through X-ray crystallography (n=124) and 
cryo-EM (n=38). We compared prediction accuracy, computational cost, and drug optimization outcomes against 
traditional homology modeling and molecular dynamics approaches. A retrospective analysis examined 18 completed 
drug discovery programs from 2020-2024.

Results: AlphaFold 3 achieved 1.8Å median RMSD for backbone prediction and 2.4Å for ligand binding poses, 
representing 34% improvement over previous methods. Prediction confidence scores (pLDDT >90) showed 97% correlation 
with experimental validation. In prospective drug optimization, AI-guided designs showed 2.3× higher success rate 
in lead optimization (45% vs 19%, p<0.001) and reduced average optimization cycles from 4.2 to 2.7. The foundation 
model reduced computational time from 72 hours (MD simulations) to 15 minutes while using 95% less computational 
resources. Integration into the pipeline accelerated preclinical candidate identification by 8-14 months.

Conclusions: Foundation models for protein structure enable accurate, rapid predictions that significantly 
accelerate drug discovery timelines and reduce computational costs, with performance approaching experimental methods.

Background: Sepsis remains a leading cause of hospital mortality with time-critical treatment windows. We conducted 
a multi-center RCT evaluating an AI-powered early warning system for sepsis prediction in intensive care units.

Methods: This pragmatic RCT enrolled 12,450 ICU patients across 24 hospitals (June 2024-January 2025). The intervention 
arm received real-time sepsis predictions from a transformer-based deep learning model analyzing 147 clinical variables 
from EHR streams (vital signs, labs, medications, nursing notes). The model was trained on 380,000 ICU admissions using 
temporal convolutional networks with attention mechanisms, predicting sepsis onset 6-12 hours before clinical criteria. 
Control arm received standard care. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes included time-to-antibiotic 
administration, ICU length of stay, and cost-effectiveness.

Results: The AI system achieved AUROC 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93-0.95) for 6-hour ahead prediction with 87% sensitivity at 
90% specificity. In the intervention arm, 28-day mortality was reduced from 14.2% to 11.3% (absolute risk reduction 
2.9%, p=0.002, NNT=34). Median time from sepsis onset to antibiotic administration decreased from 3.2 to 1.8 hours 
(p<0.001). Early detection enabled 24% reduction in median ICU length of stay (5.2 vs 6.8 days) and $8,400 lower 
per-patient costs. The system showed consistent performance across diverse patient populations and hospital settings 
with minimal performance degradation (AUROC variation 0.91-0.96). Alert fatigue was manageable with 12% false positive 
rate and positive predictive value of 31%.

Conclusions: AI-powered sepsis prediction integrated into clinical workflows significantly reduces mortality and 
healthcare costs, demonstrating the potential of machine learning for real-time clinical decision support in 
critical care settings.

Purpose: Pediatric cancer genomics requires large-scale multi-institutional collaboration, but data sharing is 
constrained by privacy regulations and institutional policies. We implemented federated learning to enable 
collaborative genomic analysis without sharing raw patient data.

Methods: We established a federated learning network across 42 pediatric oncology centers in 18 countries, 
encompassing 28,500 pediatric cancer cases with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and clinical outcomes data. Using 
secure multi-party computation and differential privacy (ε=1.2), we trained deep neural networks for cancer subtype 
classification, treatment response prediction, and survival analysis. The architecture employed graph neural networks 
to capture gene interaction patterns and attention mechanisms for variant prioritization. Each institution maintained 
local data control while contributing encrypted model updates. We compared federated model performance against 
centralized training on publicly available datasets and single-institution models.

Results: The federated model achieved 92.7% accuracy for cancer subtype classification across 23 disease categories, 
comparable to centralized training (93.1%, p=0.24) and substantially better than average single-institution performance 
(78.3%, p<0.001). For treatment response prediction, the model reached AUROC 0.88, identifying 847 novel 
genotype-phenotype associations including 23 actionable therapeutic targets. Survival prediction showed concordance 
index of 0.81. The federated approach preserved privacy with formal differential privacy guarantees while enabling 
analysis of rare disease subtypes impossible at single institutions. Model training required 6.2 days across the 
network with 18TB of aggregate data processed locally, versus 14 months for traditional IRB approvals and data 
transfers in historical multi-site studies.

Conclusions: Federated learning enables large-scale genomic research while preserving patient privacy and institutional 
data sovereignty, offering a scalable solution for collaborative precision medicine in rare diseases.

Background: Surgical skill assessment remains subjective and labor-intensive, limiting feedback during training. 
We developed vision-language models for automated, objective surgical skill evaluation with real-time feedback 
during robotic-assisted procedures.

Methods: We collected 12,000 hours of da Vinci surgical system recordings across 6,800 procedures (cholecystectomy, 
prostatectomy, hysterectomy) performed by surgeons ranging from novices (n=45) to experts (n=120). We trained a 
multimodal transformer architecture combining surgical video analysis (CLIP-based visual encoder) with procedural 
language understanding (GPT-4 based text encoder) to assess technical skills across 12 dimensions including instrument 
handling, tissue manipulation, and time-motion efficiency. The model generates natural language feedback aligned with 
OSATS (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills) criteria. We validated against expert ratings (3 blinded 
surgical educators per case) and correlated with clinical outcomes across 2,400 independent test procedures.

Results: The vision-language model achieved 0.89 correlation with expert consensus scores (Spearman's ρ, 95% CI: 
0.87-0.91) across all skill dimensions, with 94% agreement on pass/fail decisions. The model detected critical safety 
events with 96.4% sensitivity (tissue trauma, bleeding, instrument collisions) and provided contextualized feedback 
within 200ms latency enabling real-time intervention. Automated assessment scores predicted postoperative complications 
(AUROC 0.82), operative time efficiency (r=0.76), and surgeon experience level with 91% accuracy. In a pilot training 
program with 60 surgical residents, AI-powered feedback accelerated skill acquisition by 34% (p<0.001) measured by 
time to proficiency, and improved technical skill scores by 2.8 points (5-point scale) compared to traditional 
mentorship alone.

Conclusions: Vision-language AI models enable objective, scalable surgical skill assessment with real-time feedback, 
potentially transforming surgical education and quality assurance in the era of robotic surgery.
